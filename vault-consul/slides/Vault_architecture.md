## Imagine going on vacation


Notes:

* Imagine that someone is taking a vacation to a beautiful and exotic location. 
* Their trip would begin with their arrival at the hotel to check in to their room. 
* At the front desk, the receptionist asks for the person to prove their identity by providing credentials. 
* The receptionist would then check their credentials against the hotel record on file and determine that they are whom they say they are. 
* After verifying the guest's identity, the receptionist would issue the guest a room key. 
* The specific level of access granted to the guest would depend on the guest's relationship with the hotel. 
* Where a first-time guest might only receive access to their room and the hotel gym, 
a returning guest may also receive access to the guest lounge for their loyalty.
