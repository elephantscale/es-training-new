## Consul for Service Discovery

Notes:

Page 250

In a fast-moving business where applications are running on dynamic infrastructure,
determining where services are running and how they can be accessed may become a
challenge to manage. Fortunately, HashiCorp provides a solution to this dilemma with its
Consul product. By instructing applications and services to register with Consul, a service
registry can be populated, and applications can query the registry to discover and connect
to critical services throughout the organization.
