# Jenkins 


### Starting the lab instances

* In AWS, start the ubuntu with VNC instances, one per student. Give the instance at least 8 GB RAM (such as t2.large). Use security group 'jenkins on ubuntu desktop'
* (Note: in many cases, VNC is unstable. Therefore, run it only as a last resort, but otherwise
all labs are on a command line, with the browser)

#### These Jenkins materials are originally from Elevated Learning

Elephant Scale made a significant upgrade between 4/15/2017 and 5/1/2017

The upgrade included

  - Rewriting the labs with the latest version of Jenkins
    and with deeper and wider data
  - Labs were written for Linux, previously they were for Windows
