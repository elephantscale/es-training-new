# Three Dimensional Printing

Notes:  

This is a really important technology and it's a bit different than the others.  However, there does seem to be a consensus that 3d printing will have the most impact of all of the transformational technologies.

## A Different Type of Transformation

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/Captura-de-pantalla-2016-09-15-a-las-01.51.43.png" style="width:60%;">

* 3d Printing is the major enabler of the 4th Industrial Revolution

* Transforms how we build and distribute physical products
  - Other digital technologies transform how information is used
  - 3d printing transforms how materials and products are made and customized

* Has more economically disruptive potential than any other digital technology

Image is of matal part manufactured through 3d metal printing.  The part was made as a single piece similar to how we get solid objects from casting.

## Additive Manufacturing

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/20130907_TQP006_0.jpg" style="width:25%;float:right">

* 3d printing is a enhanced type of additive manufacturing
  - Product is built up in layers by adding material
  - Usually created as a single unit without needing assembly
  - Can be used with plastics, metal and even biological materials

* Subtractive manufacturing creates a product by removing material
  - For example, lathing and machining and other traditional methods
  - Usually involves waste and an assembly process

## 3d The Printing Process

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/General-3D-printing-process.png" style="width:70%">

* An object is scanned or designed to produce a 3D digital model

* The model is sliced into layers that are used to determine the fabrication logic

* The fabrication logic guides the printer to construct the final object

There is a lot implied here.  In order for this to work, there needs to be a very robust algorithm to do the planning -- machine learning and AI are a critical part of this.

## Example: Printing Prostheses
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/noseandears1-1-768x432.jpg" style="width:5
0%">

* Already used to make prosthetics, artificial skin, heart valves, veins and other body parts

* Each part can be custom designed for specific individuals even when being massed produced
  - This is possible using AI and Robotic Process Control

Image is of actual ear and nose prostheses custom designed for specific patients.  FYI, the prostheses are designed automatically from scans of the patient's body.

## Example: Bio-Printing
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/bioprinting.png" style="width:60%">

* Bio-printing (often called "meat printing") is in the early stages

* Possible uses are artificial replacement organs and mass food production

## Example: Metal Fabrication
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/MetalPrinting.jpg" style="width:70%">

* Metal 3d printing allows for complex metal parts to be build in one piece

* Does not require an assembly process like welding or fastening  

* High levels of consistent quality for mass production

3d printing also can use wood and concrete apparently although I did not find any examples.

## Example: Extreme Printing
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/metal-1024x675.jpg" style="width:50%">

* Demonstration of how complex a metal part can be

* Allows more complex types of engineering since very complicated parts can be mass produced or custom produced to exact and consistent tolerances

## Example: Industrial Production
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/fuel tank.jpg" style="width:50%;float:right;">

* Relativity Space Inc. is 3d printing metal rocket fuel tanks

* The company goal is to 3d print whole rockets

* The tank normally takes a year to produce, 3d printing it takes only 7 days

* The image shows the tank being printed by the world's largest 3d metal printer

## Rise of 3d Printing  

* Patents on 3d printing started to expire in 2009, opened up the market

* Advances in digital technology drove the 3d printing process

* Early uses were for prototyping, mostly in plastic

* Early 3d printing was very slow and very expensive

* Started to find niche market for custom and one-off items

## Market is Expanding
<img src="assets/images/lesson11/3D-Printing-Forecast2.jpg" style="width:50%">

* Improvements in digital technology increased what 3d printing could do

* Cost of printing decreased, speed of production increased

* Growth of market is exceeding predictions

## Impact on Value Chain

* The growth of 3d printing will be one of the most turbulent changes to take place in the digital transformation

* Much of the current economy is based on a model of
  - Moving raw materials from source to factory
  - Storing parts and materials until needed
  - Moving finished goods to storage
  - Distributing goods to markets

* 3d printing makes all of that obsolete

Notes:

This is the reason for why 3d printing might be the most disruptive -- it makes a large part of the economy obsolete.

## Traditional Value Chain

All following images in this series are from the same source.

The value chain represents a number of economic sectors like transportation, manufacturing, warehousing, etc.

## E-Commerce Value Chain

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/Dime-Value-Chain-ENG3-1-1024x957.jpg" style="width:50%">

Notes:

Decrease of in-person front-line service provision and centralized inventory

Mass production based on economies of scale

This is the transitional model we are seeing currently

## Industry 4.0 First Stage

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/Dime-Value-Chain-ENG4-1-1024x951.jpg" style="width:50%">

* Hybrid manufacturing uses flexible robotics and 3D printing to deliver affordable short-run and on-demand production

Notes:

---

## Distributed Manufacturing

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/Dime-Value-Chain-ENG5-1-1024x957.jpg" style="width:50%">

* Bypasses tradition manufacturers  

Notes:

Online platforms allow customers, designers, and 3D print shops to coordinate and even co-create, providing start-up entrepreneurs with a large customer base and bypassing traditional manufacturers

One-off customization

Ephemeral value chains based on economies of scope

---

## Full Digital Transformation

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/Dime-Value-Chain-ENG6-1-1024x951.jpg" style="width:45%">

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) reduces the burden of considering many or all options

* AI manages rapid complex production negotiations between multiple actors and their AIs

## Space Exploration

<img src="assets/images/lesson11/ism_logo_2016.jpg" style="width:20%;float:right;">

* 3d printing is being implemented by NASA as a way to avoid launching tons of supplies into space

* 3d printing is already being experimented with on the International Space Station

* The goal is to make space missions independent of a supply chain back to Earth
