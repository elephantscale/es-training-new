# Cloud and DevOps

## Cloud Computing

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/Cloud1.png" style="width:30%;float:right;" />

* Cloud computing refers to the use of the Internet or other remote services to performtasks that would otherwise be done on local computing resources

* Generic cloud computing can refer to any network, like a corporate network

* But now it usually refers to using a cloud service provider to provide remote computing

* Cloud services are generally dominated by large companies

## Cloud Providers

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/cloudproviders.jpg" style="width:60%;" />

* Large companies are often the only ones that have the resources to invest in large scale hardware data centers and server farms needed to host cloud computing

* Amazon, Microsoft and Google have traditionally been dominant

## Cloud Providers

* Other measures put Microsoft ahead but the market is dominated by Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure

## Physical Sites

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/aws-regions-560x298.png" style="width:70%;" />

 * Cloud providers maintain a large number of geographically dispersed computing zones or regions

 * Each region often has multiple physically independent data centers - called "availability zones" in AWS (shown in map)

## Site Transparency

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/AzureZones.png" style="width:70%;" />

* Generally where your services are hosted in a region is up to the provider

* Customers select regions often based on national regulatory compliance requirements (Azure regions show in map)

Recall here that the services physically hosted in a country are subject to the laws of that country

## Data Center

* A typical cloud data center and server farm

## Services Offered

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-1024x953.png" style="width:40%;" />

* There are three levels of how much a customer can host in the cloud

* On-Premises means no cloud computing, SaaS means everything is in the cloud

## Pizza Analogy

* The levels of service are familiar in other contexts

## Cloud Models

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/AxiomIO-public-vs-private-cloud.png" style="width:50%;" />

* Public cloud means that you are sharing resources with other customers
  - But each customer's resources are isolated from others while in use

* Private cloud means that resources are not shared with others

## Cloud Services

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/AWSServices.png" style="width:60%;" />

* Services offered range from virtual computers to big data and advanced AI to supporting mobile services and enterprise level data processing

* The hardware used to deliver these services is state of the art and always leading edge - usually more than any company can afford

## On-Demand Resources

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/Azure-new-1.png" style="width:60%;" />

* No infrastructure costs - resources are requested on an "as needed" basis
  - Customers only pay for what they use

* Microsoft Azure services shown

## Government Computing

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/govcloud-630x345.png" style="width:60%;" />

* Governments have moved significant portions on their operations to special secure cloud regions, mostly with Azure and AWS

* A main driver is to avoid computing infrastructure costs and have access to the latest technology on demand

## Cloud Computing Revenue

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/5-Image-1-Public-cloud-revenue-worldwide-.png" style="width:50%;" />

* The amount organizations are spending on cloud computing is increasing

* But this is being offset by larger savings in capital costs and the operational costs of running their own computing facilities

## DevOps

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/devops-loop-illustrations.png" style="width:50%;" />

>"DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach."

## DevOps

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/devops-loop-illustrations.png" style="width:50%;" />

>" DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technologyâ€” especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective."

## DevOps

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/differences-wp.jpg" style="width:80%;" />

* The goal of DevOps is not to create a new form of development process but to restructure teams so that they can use modern automation tools to work together more effectively and efficiently

## DevOps - Automation

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/main-qimg-9e9415998b1e5a73cfa6b984315fd2a5.png" style="width:50%;" />

* The whole DevOps process in integrated using a range to tools to achieve continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)

* Like RPA, the CI/CD tools allow the team members to focus on their real work instead of managing process overhead and routine tasks

## DevOps - Pipeline

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/pipeline-overview-update-1-31-17.png" style="width:50%;" />

* DevOps uses technology to create efficiency in the actual software production process

* The DevOps process allows team members to work together and focus on the creative and complex tasks that cannot be automated (yet)

## DevOps Adoption
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/DevOpsAdoption.png" style="width:50%;" />

* Moving from 2017 to 2018, companies are moving from piloting DevOps to mainstreaming it in their organization

* Others are realizing that they are not ready for DevOps

## DevOps Growth
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/devops-market.png" style="width:70%;" />

* DevOps is gaining ground even though many organizations have difficulty implementing it,often because they are not clear on what their own processes are that should be automated

## DevOps In the Cloud
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/devops-on-aws-accelerating-software-delivery-11-638.jpg" style="width:70%;" />

* All of the major cloud providers have full DevOps tool stacks so that an organization an implement DevOps in their cloud environment either wholly or partially
