## Blockchain

<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/us-blockchain-technology-market.png" style="width:70%;" />

* BLockchain is a technology created by an anonymous developer to implement the Bitcoin crypto-currency

* However, Blockchain has many other important applications and the market for BLockchain technology is expanding rapidly

## Defining Blockchain
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/blockchain-graphic-e1512661957968.png" style="width:60%;" />

* Blockchain consists of:
  - A collection of peers or nodes
  - A cryptographically secure distributed ledger (the block chain)
  - A transaction validation algorithm

## Blockchain Nodes
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/BN-MJ873_0201_c_P_20160201185132.jpg" style="width:40%;" />

* The nodes can be any group concerned with a common interest
  - Institutions, banks, individuals, companies, etc

* The nodes are all "voting" members of that Blockchain
  - They collectively decide whether or not to allow new transactions to be added to the ledger

## Blockchain Ledger
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/blockchainstructure.png" style="width:70%;" />

* The ledger (the Blockchain) is secure
  - Transactions cannot be altered once they are added
  - Each transaction is cryptographically integrated with previous transactions
  - Every participant has a copy of the ledger

## Blockchain Transaction
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/blockchain-graphic-e1512661957968.png" style="width:50%;" />

* A transaction is requested
  - The transaction is voted on by all of the peer nodes
  - Shared algorithms determine who can vote and how to validate a transaction
  - If validated, then the transaction is integrated into the Blockchain ledger

## Smart Contracts
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/Smart Contracts.jpg" style="width:50%;" />

* Smart contracts are self executing contracts
  - The terms are written into a Blockchain
  - The computer code necessary to execute the contract is also part of the Blockchain
  - When the triggering event for the contract occurs, the contract executes

* Contract cannot be altered after being created, and a permanent record is kept

## Blockchain Applications
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/Applications-of-BlockChain-Technology.jpg" style="width:40%;" />

* Blockchain can be used anywhere that a secure transaction or authentication is needed

* Has the potential to revolutionize
  - Financial transactions of all types
  - Contract enforcement
  - Regulatory compliance
  - Intellectual and other property rights
  - Any system based on transactions

* Existing model - multiple parties with their own records
  - System is disjointed and requires constant reconciliation

## Smart Cities
<img src="../assets/images/digital-transformation/3rd-party/smart-city-slider.jpg" style="width:50%;" />

* Different types of IoT sensors collect data from multiple sources
  - cell phones, traffic cameras, sensors etc

* Data analytics produces insights to manage resources and services efficiently
  - Automated resources are issued instructions (changing traffic light timing for example)
