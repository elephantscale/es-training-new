Notes on the slide development.

#### Unsecure Direct Object Attack

This is a bit ambiguous for me since it could refer to either
1. A directory traversal sort of attack 
2. An insecure indirect object reference attack - one of the OWASP top ten attacks

We would put both in but if there was a specific intent on this to only do one of them.

#### Labs
I don't know if you have any labs for this section. If not, it would be an easy add to use the OWASP webgoat labs.  They would only require running a docker image.

### encryption

What specific sort of attack should be covered here?
- RSA encryption attacks - some of which seem like they might be a bit too advanced.
- At this point I'm assuming maybe just a quick overview to show the sort of attacks that can take place

Or were there some other attacks, like ransomeware, that is intended here?
