#### Unsecure Direct Object Attack

This is a bit ambiguous for me since it could refer to either
1. A directory traversal sort of attack 
2. An insecure indirect object reference attack - one of the OWASP top ten attacks

We would put both in but if there was a specific intent on this to only do one of them.
