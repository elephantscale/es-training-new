## Practically

* You could do this:
* Validate all inputs
* Protect against all (?) attacks
* Encrypt your data, in motion and in rest
* And you will not be blamed
* But this is dull
  - and brings no new functionality

---

 
## Suggestion
* At times, let us play games
* Red Team attacks
* Blue Team defends
* Tell your boss, you are doing security :)

---



## Criminal Economy
* Criminal marketplaces
* Escrow services
* Bitcoin
* Vouchers
* Gift cards

---


## Is FBI involved?

* Yes
* Working with other agencies
* Across borders
* But they can only do so much

---


## Criminal Operations
* Highly specialized
* Productized
* How can we imitate it?
* By acquiring either a Red Team of Blue Team specialization
