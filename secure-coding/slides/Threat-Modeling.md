## STRIDE a.k.a
* finding threats
* threat enumeration
* threat analysis 
* threat elicitation
* threat discovery

Notes:

* Each connotes a slightly different flavor of approach. Do the threats exist in the software or the diagram? Then you're finding them. Do they exist in the minds of the people doing the analysis? Then you're doing analysis or elicitation. No single description stands out as always or clearly preferable, but this book generally talks about finding threats as a superset of all these ideas.

* Using STRIDE is more like an elicitation technique, with an expectation that you or your team understand the framework and know how to use it. If you're not familiar with STRIDE, the extensive tables and examples are designed to teach you how to use it to discover threats.
