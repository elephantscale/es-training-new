# Resource Quotas
---

## Definition

- **Why Quotas?**: Quotas are essential in multi-tenant environments to prevent any single tenant from monopolizing the resources, ensuring fair distribution.
- **Hard vs Soft Quotas**: Hard quotas are strict limits, while soft quotas may allow temporary exceedance. Understanding the distinction helps in different scenarios.
- **Impact on Users**: Quotas affect user ability to launch instances or use resources. Setting them properly helps in maintaining both system stability and user satisfaction.
---
## Types of Resources

- **Compute Resources**: This includes instances, CPU cores, and RAM. They are essential to control as they directly affect the performance of virtual machines.
- **Network Resources**: These include limits on the creation of networks, routers, and floating IPs, crucial for the network structure of the system.
- **Storage Resources**: Controlling volumes and snapshots helps to manage storage utilization.
- **Custom Resource Types**: OpenStack allows extending quotas to cover other customized resources, offering flexibility in controlling various system aspects.
---
## Project-Level vs User-Level

- **Project Scope**: Quotas at this level apply to all users within a project, ensuring the total usage of the project doesn't exceed set limits.
- **User Scope**: These are individual user quotas within a project. Managing them allows control over individual consumption within the broader project limits.
- **Priority and Conflicts**: Administrators must reconcile conflicts between project and user quotas, balancing individual freedom with overall project limitations.
---
## Default and Necessity

- **Setting Default Quotas**: OpenStack sets predefined limitations that are usually adjusted to fit the particular environment.
- **Changing Defaults**: Modifying defaults may be necessary to reflect the actual capacity of the infrastructure.
- **Importance of Balance**: Quotas must be set judiciously to ensure fair access without under-utilizing or overcommitting resources.

---

# Configuring Quotas

---

## Setting and Modifying

- **Methods**: Using the CLI, Horizon dashboard, or APIs, administrators can set or modify quotas. Each method has its applications and advantages.
- **Considerations**: Quotas must align with the actual physical hardware capabilities to prevent over-allocation.
- **Common Adjustments**: Regular changes may be needed due to business growth, changes in project requirements, or adjustments in hardware availability.

---

## Hierarchical Quotas

- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical quotas are useful for complex organizational structures, allowing more nuanced control.
- **Implementation**: This involves defining parent-child relationships between projects, reflecting the organizational hierarchy.
- **Challenges**: Managing a complex hierarchy can be daunting. Proper planning and understanding of the needs and relationships between projects are key to overcoming these challenges.

---

# Monitoring Usage

---
## Tools and Alerts

- **Monitoring Tools**: OpenStack offers various tools like Ceilometer to keep track of resource usage. They provide real-time data to understand how close users or projects are to their quota limits.
- **Alerting Mechanisms**: Administrators can create custom alerts for when quotas are nearing or have reached the limits. These warnings facilitate proactive management and prevent unexpected resource exhaustion.
---
## Reports and Compliance

- **Report Generation**: Regular reports can be generated to analyze usage trends, allowing insights into how resources are consumed. This information is vital for planning future resource allocation.
- **Compliance Checks**: Monitoring tools also provide the ability to audit usage against set quotas. It ensures that all users and projects are operating within the established boundaries, maintaining system integrity.
---
# Quota Templates
---
## Creation and Purpose

- **Template Design**: Templates help in standardizing quotas across similar projects or users. They can be designed to reflect organizational policies and promote consistency.
- **Usage Scenarios**: Templates are especially useful in large organizations with multiple projects that have similar resource needs. They reduce administrative overhead by applying standardized settings.

---

## Applying and Adjusting

- **Application**: Assigning templates streamlines the process of setting quotas for new or existing projects, ensuring a uniform approach.
- **Modification**: Changes in organizational needs or project requirements might necessitate adjustments to templates. OpenStack facilitates these changes, allowing updates to reflect the current needs.

---
# Enforcement and Exceptions
---

## Mechanisms and Overages

- **Enforcement Techniques**: OpenStack enforces quotas through a combination of monitoring and hard limits. If a user attempts to exceed a hard quota, the request is denied, maintaining the set boundaries.
- **Handling Exceedances**: In case of an attempted exceedance, a notification can be sent, and the request denied or queued. Administrators have the flexibility to handle these situations based on policy.

---

## Requests and Overrides

- **Exception Handling**: Users can request exceptions to quotas for special cases. The process is usually defined by organizational policy and may require justification and approval.
- **Administrator Overrides**: Administrators have the authority to override quotas in exceptional circumstances. This flexibility ensures that critical projects can proceed even if they require temporary excess resources.

---


## Troubleshooting with OpenStack CLI

- **Log Analysis**: Using CLI to access and analyze logs.
- **Resource Inspection**: Detailed inspection of resources (instances, volumes, networks) using CLI.
- **Debugging Commands**: Specialized CLI commands for debugging.
