Despite the hype, Jason Calacanis made a really good recap of the legitimate, ROI bearing corporate use cases of ChatGPT:
1.) Contant summarization: the ability to scan, interpret, and summarize a cliff notes version of web content, text, conversation, and some forms of raw data.
2.) Support and service: lousy chat bots have already eliminated probably 25% of tech support and customer service calls, this should be an extinction event for them, companies should be able to illuminate 50% of such low value, high noise, repetitive calls by implementing chat, GPT as a replacement, and doing some basic training on the company, knowledge base and existing call history.
This, however, is an opportunity for system, integrators to do the last mile off duty, integration, and CPT training, and evolve such technologies over time.
The more forward, thinking, global system and readers, well transform their dumber BPO operations in to chat, GPT operators, and identify and enhance opportunities for data, labeling and annotation for a feature engineering improvement, possibly even be inputs for reinforcement learning from human practices.
3.) Content generation beyond text, and even stable diffusion type imagery is going to truly materialize inside of code generation, and become a force multiplier for experience developers, and also invite in the “citiizen developer” for the golden age of application and artificial intelligence development.
