## Make your presentation 

* Exercise: we think through the presentation, then practice it in breakout rooms. 
* What is the presentation? - Talk about yourself

---

## My story

* How I started
* Let's look at one example

## Unfaithful wife

## Now - you

* Did you ever hold your audience's attention?

---

## Your presentation

* Shelling oysters or giving the pearls

---

## Your audience

* Who do I think you are?

Notes:

* Avoid the generic qualifiers
* Exclude outliers
* Of course, know about your audience

---

## Who am I?

* What puts you in the center?

Notes:
