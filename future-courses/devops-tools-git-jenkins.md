# DevOps Tools with Git and Jenkins

Â© Elephant Scale

January 13, 2020

Developers and DevOps engineers need collaboration tools to write effective code, 
implement Test Driven Development methodologies, and automate deployments. Continuous Integration and 
Continuous Delivery are best practices in handling complex development and 
deployment scenatios while a product is under development.

Git and Jenkins are the twin pillars of the developers' Continuous Integration and
Continuous Delivery toolbox.  By using these tools effectively, developers and dev/ops
engineers can ensure much higher quality code and better results.
