## Overview

Kafka is definitely one of the leading distributed messaging queues, 
found in use everywhere. More correctly called “a distributed messaging platform,” 
it provides three key capabilities: publish-and-subscribe, store streams, and process streams. 
This course introduces the students to using Kafka and architecting systems with it.
