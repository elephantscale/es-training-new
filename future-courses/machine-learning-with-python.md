# Machine Learning With Python

© Elephant Scale

Jan. 03, 2020

## Overview

This course introduces popular Machine Learning techniques.

This course is intended for data scientists and software engineers. 
We assume no previous knowledge of Machine Learning.
We teach popular Machine Learning algorithms from scratch.

For each machine learning concept, we first discuss the foundations, its applicability and limitations. Then we explain the implementation and use, and specific use cases. This is achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% lab work.

Please note that this course does not cover in-depth coverage of Math / Stats is behind Machine Learning.

This course will be taught with Python Language

## What you will learn
- Get introduced to Machine Learning
- Find out how to use Machine Learning tools on Microsoft Azure
- Understand how to use automated Machine Learning
- Learn the best practices and real-world use cases

## Audience
Developers, Architects

## Duration
3 days 

## Format
Lectures and hands-on labs. (50%, 50%)
