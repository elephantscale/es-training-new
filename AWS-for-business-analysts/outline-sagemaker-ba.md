# SageMaker for Business Analysts

### Course Overview

* Using the tools based on SQL, business analysts can answer the questions of “What is going on?” drill down into the details, and sometimes also answer the “Why is it going this way?”
* However, if they want to ask, “What will be in the future?” or “How we should plan for the future?” the analysts should turn to Machine Learning. AI and Machine Learning usually deal with the prediction of likely future events.

* This 1-day course teaches the analysts how to choose the right questions to ask and how to answer them with Machine Learning. It gives an understanding of the practical capabilities of Machine Learning and demonstrates how one can benefit from them using SageMaker.

*Note: The course is oriented toward AWS but it can be also for Azure or Google Cloud*

### Duration: 
* 1 day

### Audience: 
* Business Analysts
* Data Analysts
* Business Intelligence (BI) Analysts

### More about the audience

* These people (or at least about 40-50% of them) tend to use SAS and R
 and build regression models, forecasting models, etc. 
* The other half are solidly SQL types - who will analyze structured data using BI, OLAP etc. 
*  They are the ones analyzing the results of “models” that were deployed and whether that provided the desired target (e.g. shift in customer demographic, increase in sales of product X, etc.)

### Prerequisites: 
* Familiarity with programming in at least one programming language
* Basic familiarity with AWS

### Lab environment: 
* Training Amazon account will be provided by the student’s company. 
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' laptops.
