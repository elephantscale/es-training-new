© Elephant Scale
Dec. 20, 2019

Major topics to be practically covered

- Google big query
- data proc
- basic TensorFlow
- visualication tools 

Overview
Data Science is all the rage today, and Google is one of the major promoters of it. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the leading platforms for Data Science.
In this course, the students will get an overview of Data Science with Python, a standard environment for Data Science. They will also learn the specifics of the GCP and the capabilities that it offers to Data Scientists.

What you will learn:
Schedule data ingest with App Engine
Present your data in a dashboard using Google Data Studio
Use streaming analytics Build a real-time analysis pipeline to carry out 
Explore data with Google BigQuery
Create a Machine Learning model on a Cloud Dataproc 
Predict house prices with Spark
Compute time-aggregate features using Cloud Dataflow pipeline
Create a high-performing prediction model with TensorFlow
Deployed models as a microservice for batch and real-time pipelines
 
 
 
Audience:
Developers, Architects
Duration:
Three to four days depending on the need
Format:
Lectures and hands-on labs. (50%, 50%)
Prerequisites
Interested in Data Science (data science overview is included in this outline as needed)
comfortable in the Linux environment (be able to navigate Linux command line, run commands)
Lab environment
Zero Install: There is no need to install any software on students’ machines! A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.
Students will need the following
an SSH client (Linux and Mac already have ssh clients, for Windows Putty is recommended)
a browser to access the cluster. We recommend Chrome browser
