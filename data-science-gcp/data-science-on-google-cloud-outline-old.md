# Google Cloud for Data Scientists
Dec. 20, 2019

## Overview
Data Science is all the rage today, and Google is one of the major promoters of it. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the leading platforms for Data Science.
In this course, the students will get an overview of Data Science with Python, a standard environment for Data Science. They will also learn the specifics of the GCP and the capabilities that it offers to Data Scientists.

## Topics Covered
- Google big query
- data proc
- Basic TensorFlow
- Visualization tools 

## What you will learn:
- Schedule data ingest with App Engine
- Present your data in a dashboard using Google Data Studio
- Use streaming analytics Build a real-time analysis pipeline to carry out 
- Explore data with Google BigQuery
- Create a Machine Learning model on a Cloud Dataproc 
- Running Machine Learning With Spark on Google Cloud
- Compute time-aggregate features using Cloud Dataflow pipeline
- Create a deep learning model with TensorFlow
- Deploy models as a microservice for batch and real-time pipelines
 
 
 
## Audience:
Developers, Architects

## Duration:
Three to four days depending on the agenda

## Format:
Lectures and hands-on labs. (50%, 50%)

## Prerequisites
- Interested in Data Science (data science overview is included as needed)
- Some basic knowledge of Python is highly recommended but not mandatory.  
  Our labs utilize Python language.  But Python is a very easy language to learn. So even you don't have previous exposure to Python, you will be able to complete the labs.
- Some programming experience is highly recommended

## Lab environment
Zero Install: There is no need to install any software on students' machines! A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

**Students will need the following**  
- A reasonably modern laptop
- Unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
- Chrome browser 
- SSH client for your platform
