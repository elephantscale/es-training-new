## Continuous integration is elusive


 * As above, Spinnaker is king, however...

 * Survey says

     - 14% deploy on an hourly basis

     - 34% deploy once a day

     - 21% deploy weekly and 31% deploy less often than weekly

 * (See https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/03/agile-king-ci-ilusive-goal)
