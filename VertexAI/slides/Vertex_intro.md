## What is VertexAI

* Vertex AI is a fully-managed, unified AI development platform for building and using generative AI 
* AI Studio
* Agent Builder
* 130+ foundation models including Gemini 1.5 Proâ€”all

---

## Gemini

* Vertex AI offers access to Gemini models from Google
* Gemini is capable of 
  * understanding virtually any input, 
  * combining different types of information, 
  * and generating almost any output.

## State-of-the-art generation capabilities
* developers can try sample prompts for extracting text from images, 
* converting image text to JSON, and even 
* generate answers about uploaded images to build next-gen AI applications.
* Gemma,
  * a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models 
  * built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.

## Vertex AI Notebooks

* Colab Enterprise or Workbench
* natively integrated with BigQuery
* single surface across all data and AI workloads.

## MLOps for predictive and generative AI
* Orchestrate workflows
* Vertex AI Pipelines helps you automate, monitor, and govern your ML workflows.
* Vertex ML Metadata 
* Identify the best model for a use case
* Vertex AI Experiments lets you track and analyze different model architectures, hyper-parameters, and training environments 
* Vertex AI TensorBoard helps you track, visualize, and compare ML experiments to measure how well your models perform.
* Manage model versions 
  * Adding models to a central repository helps you keep track of model versions.
* Vertex AI Model Registry provides an overview of your models so you can better organize, track, and train new versions.
