It would be great if you also can provide about Network Design and Best Practice 

Moreover, you may discuss with trainer that the topic will relate about the ground knowledge of Automation System. It will relate with the Automation Pyramid according to ISA95 which is an international standard from the International Society of Automation for developing an automated interface between enterprise and control systems. While OSI model will describe about the network system which including the standard protocol. All topic will be related and linked each other.
