<img src="../what.jpg" style="width:25%;"/>

## What is Ansible?

* Ansible is a simple IT automation tool that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy.
* Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications
* automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.
* Ansible is agentless, so you don’t have to install software on remote systems to manage them.

---

## Where to use Ansible

* Configuration Management
* Application Deployment
* Continuous Delivery
* Orchestration
* Security Automation
* Multi-Tier Applications
* Cloud Provisioning
* Network Automation
* And more...

---

## Agentless

Target systems do not need to have any software installed on them to be managed by Ansible.

Tasks are executed over SSH by default, but can also be executed locally.

<img src="../images/img.png" style="width:35%;"/>

<span style="font-size:15px; color:red">_except for Windows systems, which require a small Python executable to be installed._</span>

---

# Why Agentless?

The reasons for this choice in the Ansible design are many, not least that just about every Linux/FreeBSD/macOS host has it built in, as do many network devices such as switches and routers.

---

# Idempotent

Ansible is idempotent, meaning that it can be run multiple times without changing the state of the system.

---

<img src="../note.jpg" style="width:45%;"/>


Ansible is not a configuration management tool

BUT

it can be used to manage configuration files.

---

## Ansible Terms

---

# Inventory

---


## Inventory

* A list of hosts that Ansible can manage
* Can be static or dynamic
* Can be defined in a file or in the command line


```ini

mailserver mail.example.com

[webserver]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[appserver]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com
mailserver
```
---

# INI Format

* The INI format is a simple format that uses sections and key/value pairs
* The sections are the groups of hosts
* The key/value pairs are the hosts and their attributes
* The attributes are optional
* The attributes are used to define the connection parameters
* The attributes are defined in the form of key=value pairs
* The attributes are defined after the host name

---

# Static Inventory

* A static inventory is a list of hosts defined in a file
* The file is usually called `hosts` and is located in the `/etc/ansible` directory
* The file can be in any format, but the most common one is the INI format

---

## Example

```ini
[webserver]
<Machine-IP>  ansible_ssh_pass=<Password>


[webserver:vars]
ansible_user=<Username>

[appserver]
<Machine-IP> ansible_ssh_pass=<Password>

[appserver:vars]
ansible_user=<Username> # ( ubuntu in our environment )
```

---

# Dynamic Inventory

* A dynamic inventory is a list of hosts that is generated by a script
* The script can be written in any language
* The script can be written to query a database, a cloud provider, or any other source
* The script must return a JSON object with the list of hosts and their attributes
* The script must be located in the `/etc/ansible` directory

---

## Patterns

* Patterns let you run commands and playbooks against specific hosts and/or groups in your inventory

* Pattern can refer to a single host, an IP address, an inventory group, a set of groups, or all hosts in your inventory

* highly flexible
  * Can exclude or require subsets of hosts
  * Use wildcards or regular expressions
  * And more…

---

# Install Ansible

---

## Install Ansible


* Ansible is written in Python and, as such, can be installed on a wide range of systems

  * Debian
  * RedHat
  * FreeBSD

* macOS

The one exception to this is Windows, though native Python distributions exist, there is yet no native Ansible build.


---

The release cycle for Ansible is usually about four months, and during this short release cycle, there are normally many changes, from minor bug fixes to major ones, to new features and even sometimes fundamental changes.

The simplest way to not only get up and running with Ansible but to keep yourself up to date is to use the native packages built for your operating system where they are available.

* ad hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable.
* ad hoc tasks can be used to reboot servers, copy files, manage packages and users, and much more. 
* You can use any Ansible module in an ad hoc task. 
* ad hoc commands demonstrate the simplicity and power of Ansible
* It will port over directly to the playbook language

# Ansible Playbook

---

# Ansible Handlers

---

## Handlers

* Handlers in Ansible are special tasks that are only executed when a change has been made.

* They are used to trigger a specific action, such as restarting a service, after a configuration change has been made.

* Handlers are defined in the playbook, just like regular tasks.

* The difference is that handlers are associated with a specific event, such as a configuration file being changed.

* Handlers are triggered using the notify keyword in a task, which tells Ansible to execute the handler if the task makes any changes.

* Handlers are useful for managing complex configurations where multiple tasks may need to be executed in a specific order.

* Handlers are executed at the end of a playbook run, after all tasks have been completed.

* Handlers can be defined globally in a playbook or in a specific role.

---

## Example

![img_1.png](../images/handler.png)

---

In the previous above, the handler is named "restart apache" and will restart the Apache service.

* The "listen" keyword is used to associate the handler with a specific task that will trigger it.

* Handlers can also be used with variables, allowing you to define more dynamic configurations.

* Handlers are a powerful feature of Ansible that can help you manage complex configurations and ensure that your systems are always up-to-date.

---

## Best practices

* Only use handlers when necessary
* Use descriptive names for handlers
* Define handlers in a separate file to keep your playbook organized
* Test your handlers thoroughly to ensure they work as expected


## Playbook

A playbook is a collection of tasks that define the desired state of a system.

Playbooks are written in YAML format and can be used to manage a wide range of systems, from simple web servers to complex multi-tier applications.

---

## Example

![img_3.png](../images/img_3.png)

---

## Task Structure

A task is a single module with a set of arguments.

![img.png](img.png)

---

# Ansible Variables

---

## Variables

* Variables are used to store information that can be used in playbooks and templates.

* Variables can be defined in the playbook or in a separate file.

* Variables are defined in the form of key=value pairs.

* Variables are defined in the vars section of the playbook.

* Variables can be used in the tasks section of the playbook.

---

## Example

![img_1.png](../images/img_13.png)

---

## Variables Prompt

* Variables can be prompted for user input.
* The prompt can be defined in the vars section of the playbook.

---

## Example

![img_2.png](../images/img_14.png)

`name`: variable name

`prompt`: prompt message

`default`: default if user skips the prompt

`private`: hide the input from the screen

---

## Variables File

* Variables can be defined in a separate file.
* The file can be in any format, but the most common one is the YAML format.
* The file must be located in the same directory or relative to the playbook.
* The file must be named anything that you need.
* The file must be defined in the vars_files section of the playbook.
  * There is a module called `include_vars` that can be used to include variables from a file as a task.

---

## Variables Register

* Variables can be registered to store the output of a task.

![img_2.png](../images/variabels/img_2.png)

---

## Variables Set Fact

Variables can be set as facts to store the output of a task using `set_fact` module

these variables can be accessed like a normal variable

![img_3.png](../images/variabels/img_3.png)

Note: If you have `redis` installed, you can use `cached` to store these variables for later use.

---


# Ansible Condition

---

## Condition

* Ansible supports conditional execution of tasks.
* The condition can be defined in the `when` section of the task.
* The condition can be defined as a string, a list of strings, or a dictionary.
* Strings must be a valid expression.
* Lists of strings must be valid expressions.
* Dictionaries must be valid expressions.
* The condition can be defined as a Jinja2 expression.
* The condition can be defined as a variable.

---

## Example

![img_1.png](../images/cond_sample.png)

---

## Condition Operators

* Ansible supports the following operators:
  * `and`
  * `or`
  * `not`
  * `==`
  * `!=`
  * `>`
  * `>=`
  * `<`
  * `<=`
* The condition can be defined as a Jinja2 expression.
* The condition can be defined as a variable.

---

## Condition Expressions

* Ansible supports the following expressions:
  * `true`
  * `false`
  * `none`
* The condition can be defined as a Jinja2 expression.
* The condition can be defined as a variable.
* The condition can be defined as a list.
  * The list must contain valid expressions.
  * `and` operator is used between each item of the list.


---

## Condition Variables

* Ansible supports the following variables:
  * `ansible_facts`
  * `ansible_hostname`
  * `ansible_host`
  * `ansible_os_family`
  * `ansible_os_name`
  * `ansible_os_version`
  * `ansible_playbook_python`
  * `ansible_python`
  * ...
---

# Ansible Loop

---

## Loop

Ansible provides a simple and efficient way to iterate over a set of values using loops in a playbook.
---

## The with_items Loop

The `with_items` loop is the most commonly used loop in Ansible. It iterates over a list of items and performs a task for each item.

![img_1.png](../images/loop_1.png)

---

## The `loop` Loop

The `loop` loop is a newer alternative to with_items loop, and it offers more flexibility and readability. It allows you to loop over a list or dictionary of items, and use the item variable to access each item.

![img_2.png](../images/loop_2.png)


---

## Using Loops with Conditionals

You can also use loops with conditionals to perform tasks based on certain conditions.

![img_3.png](../images/loop_3.png)


---

## The loop_control Keyword

The loop_control keyword allows you to modify the behavior of the loop. For example, you can use it to set the loop index, skip items, or stop the loop.

![img_4.png](../images/loop_4.png)


---

## Conclusion

Loops in Ansible Playbook provide an efficient way to perform repetitive tasks. With the with_items and loop loops, you can iterate over a list of items or a dictionary, and use conditionals and loop_control keyword to modify the behavior of the loop.


# Ansible Block

---

## Blocks in Ansible Playbook

* Blocks are a way to group related tasks together in an Ansible playbook
* They can be used to apply conditions, retries, and error handling to a set of tasks as a single unit
* Blocks can make playbooks more readable and easier to maintain


---

## Syntax of Blocks in Ansible Playbook

The syntax for defining a block in an Ansible playbook is as follows:

![img_1.png](../images/block_1.png)

* The `block` keyword is used to define the set of tasks that should be grouped together
* The `rescue` keyword is used to define a set of tasks to be run if any task in the block fails
* The `always` keyword is used to define a set of tasks to be run regardless of whether the block succeeds or fails


---

## Example

![img_2.png](../images/block_2.png)

---

* In this example, the tasks for installing and starting the Apache web server are grouped together in a block
* If any task in the block fails, the rescue tasks will be executed to handle the failure
* The always tasks will be executed regardless of whether the block succeeds or fails, in this case to clean up a lock file created during the installation

---

## Benefits

* Using blocks in an Ansible playbook can make the playbook more readable and easier to maintain by grouping related tasks together
* Blocks can also make it easier to apply conditions, retries, and error handling to a set of tasks as a single unit
* Using blocks can help to reduce duplication and make playbooks more modular
* By using blocks, it is possible to write more robust and error-tolerant playbooks
