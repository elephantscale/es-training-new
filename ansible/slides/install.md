## Install Ansible 


* Ansible is written in Python and, as such, can be installed on a wide range of systems
  
  * Debian
  * RedHat
  * FreeBSD
   
* macOS

The one exception to this is Windows, though native Python distributions exist, there is yet no native Ansible build.


---

The release cycle for Ansible is usually about four months, and during this short release cycle, there are normally many changes, from minor bug fixes to major ones, to new features and even sometimes fundamental changes.

The simplest way to not only get up and running with Ansible but to keep yourself up to date is to use the native packages built for your operating system where they are available.
