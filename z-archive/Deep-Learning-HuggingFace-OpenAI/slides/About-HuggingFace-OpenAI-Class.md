## Pre-requisites and Expectations


 * Basic machine learning familiarity is assumed

 * Have a Python development environment

     - We will set this up in class
     
     - Or use yours

 * Curiosity!

   - Ask a lot of questions 

 * This is a Deep Learning & Advanced Applications based on HuggingFace class
   - No previous knowledge is assumed (but may be helpful) 
   - Class will be based on the pace of majority of the students

## Our Teaching Philosophy


 * Emphasis on concepts & fundamentals

 * API - no need to learn anything by heart

 * Highly interactive (questions and discussions are welcome)

 * Hands-on (learn by doing)
