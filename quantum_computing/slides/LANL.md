## Summary


* As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has arisen to train a cohort of quan-
tum programmers, many of whom have been developing classical computer programs for most of their careers. 
* While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computing hardware
is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality, and connectivity. 
* We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct
and self-contained fashion.
