## Quantum computing is easy

* Even babies know it

## Why learn quantum computing?

* Moore law
  * Number of transistors per silicon chip doubles every year, or every 18 months
  * But now, this law does not work
  * Because with small transistors there is electrical leakage
  * And because of heat
  * We use smaller chips, we come to subatomic particles, and these are in the realm of quantum mechanics
  * Cost of cooling in server rooms

---

## Why else to learn about quantum computing
* Better factoring prime numbers
  * Better, not hackable encryption

* New research
  * Quantum communication, networks, internet
    * Novel ways of information transfer

---

## One more reason - optimization

* Quantum computer are very good about solving optimization problems
  * Calculating optimal route for delivery
  * Scheduling flights
  
---

## And one more advantage of QC
* QC is very good at specific problems
  * They will not replace classic computers, but...
  * Exponentially accelerate Machine Learning
  * We will implement it! With IBM Qiskit!!
