## Cleveland clinic

* One of the largest research centers
* IBM is partnering with Cleveland Clinic to introduce the first quantum computer ever deployed on site in the private sector
* For researchers at Cleveland Clinic, it means the **chance** to develop more precise, targeted, and effective medicines
* We **don’t yet know** precisely which breakthroughs quantum computing will help us achieve

## Scott Wyman extended answer

* Hey Mark, what Aliro is doing is building a quantum network for EPB. Initially the network will be used for research. However, I see networking itself as a practical application. The overriding question is, "Is quantum networking part of quantum computing? Or is it a separate discipline?" Having worked in both, I see quantum computing and quantum networking as separate discipline, much like a classical chip designer might not know much about network engineering and vice versa. But in the industry, quantum networking tends to be viewed as a subset of quantum computing.
* Aliro might be a particularly interesting case study for your course, since we are often described as "the quantum Cisco", and the very early stage networking we are doing is similar to the early classical networks that Cisco built in the 80s

* It should be said that there is no practical task that people widely agree can be done better on an existing quantum computer compared to a classical computer. Stay tuned!
