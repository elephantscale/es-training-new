## Cleveland clinic

* One of the largest research centers
* IBM is partnering with Cleveland Clinic to introduce the first quantum computer ever deployed on site in the private sector
* For researchers at Cleveland Clinic, it means the **chance** to develop more precise, targeted, and effective medicines
* We **don’t yet know** precisely which breakthroughs quantum computing will help us achieve
