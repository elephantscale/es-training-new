## Intro

* This part is about mathematical theory of quantum information
* Formal presentation of definitions, theorems, and proofs. 
* It is primarily intended for graduate students and researchers having some familiarity with quantum information and computation
  * such as would be covered in an introductory-level undergraduate or graduate course, 
  * or in one of several  books on the subject that now exist.

## What it is about
* Quantum information science has seen an explosive development in recent years, particularly within the past two decades. 
* A comprehensive treatment of the subject, even if restricted to its theoretical aspects, would certainly require a series of books rather than just one. 
* Consistent with this fact, the selection of topics covered herein is not intended to be fully representative of the subject. Quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, quantum  algorithms and complexity theory, quantum cryptography, and topological quantum computation are among the many interesting and fundamental  topics found within the theoretical branches of quantum information science  that are not covered in this book. 
* Nevertheless, one is likely to encounter some of the core mathematical notions discussed in this book when studying  these topics.

## Linear algebra

* Complex Euclidean spaces
* Linear operators
* Operator decompositions and norms

## Linear algebra
* The theory of quantum information relies heavily on linear algebra in finite-dimensional spaces. 
* The subsections that follow present an overview of the aspects of this subject that are most relevant within the theory of quantum information. 
* It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the most basic notions of linear algebra, including those of linear dependence and independence, subspaces, spanning sets, bases, and dimension.

## Complex Euclidean spaces

* The notion of a complex Euclidean space is used throughout these slides. 
* One associates a complex Euclidean space with every discrete and finite system;
* fundamental notions such as states and measurements of systems are represented in linear-algebraic terms that refer to these spaces.

## Definition of complex Euclidean spaces

* An alphabet is a finite and nonempty set, whose elements may be considered to be symbols. 
* Alphabets will generally be denoted by capital Greek letters,
* including Σ, Γ, and Λ, 
* while lower case Roman letters near the beginning of the alphabet, including a, b, c, and d, will be used to denote symbols in alphabets. 
* Examples of alphabets include 
  * the binary alphabet {0, 1}, 
  * the n-fold Cartesian product {0, 1} n of the binary alphabet with itself, 
  * and the alphabet {1, . . . , n}, 
  * for n being a fixed positive integer.
