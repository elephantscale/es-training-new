# Entanglement


---

Entangling qubits, which is a fundamental process in quantum computing, involves putting qubits into a state where the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This is a key feature of quantum mechanics and is central to the power of quantum computers.

Here's a simple way to entangle a pair of qubits using quantum gates in a quantum circuit. We'll use the Hadamard gate (H) and the controlled NOT gate (CNOT) which are commonly available in quantum computing platforms:

1. Start with two qubits in the initial state `|00>` (both qubits are in the 0 state).

2. Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the first qubit. The Hadamard gate puts the qubit into a superposition of states, meaning it is in both the `|0>` and `|1>` state simultaneously. After applying the Hadamard gate, the state of the system is `(|00> + |10>)/sqrt(2)`.

3. Now apply a CNOT gate with the first qubit as control and the second as target. The CNOT gate flips the target qubit if the control qubit is in the `|1>` state. So, after applying the CNOT gate, the state of the system is `(|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2)`.

Now the two qubits are entangled. This means that if you were to measure the state of the first qubit, and found it in the state `|0>`, you would instantly know that the second qubit is also in the state `|0>`. Similarly, if you found the first qubit in the state `|1>`, you would know the second qubit is in the state `|1>`.

This process relies on access to a quantum computer or simulator and an understanding of quantum mechanics and quantum computing principles. Quantum computing is a rapidly developing field, and the methods and technologies available are likely to change over time.

Please note that while this is a simple example of entangling qubits, creating and maintaining entanglement in a practical quantum computing system can be quite challenging, due to issues like decoherence and noise.

In the physical world, entangling particles, such as photons or electrons, requires experimental setups that exploit specific quantum mechanical properties of these particles. While there are several ways to generate entangled particles, I'll describe two common methods: one for photons and one for electrons.

1. Photons (using spontaneous parametric down-conversion):

In this process, a nonlinear crystal is used to convert a single high-energy photon (called a pump photon) into two lower-energy entangled photons. When the pump photon passes through the nonlinear crystal, it has a certain probability of being converted into a pair of photons, which are entangled in polarization.

The polarization of each photon is undefined until measured, but once one photon's polarization is measured, the other photon's polarization will be correlated due to their entangled nature.

2. Electrons (using superconductors and Josephson junctions):

Entangled electron pairs, called Cooper pairs, can be created in superconductors at low temperatures. When certain materials are cooled to near absolute zero, they exhibit superconductivity, allowing electrons to flow through them with zero resistance.

In these superconductors, two electrons with opposite spins can become entangled, forming Cooper pairs. Josephson junctions, which are thin insulating barriers between two superconductors, can be used to manipulate and control these entangled pairs.

Both methods require sophisticated equipment and specialized knowledge in the fields of quantum optics and condensed matter physics, respectively. It is important to note that these are not the only methods for creating entangled particles, but they are among the most well-established and widely studied techniques. Additionally, maintaining and manipulating entangled particles is a delicate process that is sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, noise, and vibrations.
