# Bits

## Splitting information into bits

* 9000+200+10+3
* Think of a number and try to write it down in binary.
* If you have n bits, how many different states can they be in?

## Addition in binary

```text
   10001111111101
+  00011100111110

=  ??????????????

   10001111111101
+  00011100111110
=  ???????????011 

```

## 1 + 1
