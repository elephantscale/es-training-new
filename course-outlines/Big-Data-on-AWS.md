# Big Data on AWS

Â© Elephant Scale

October 17, 2023

In this course, you will learn about cloud-based Big Data solutions such as Amazon EMR, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Kinesis, and the rest of the AWS Big Data platform. We will show you how to use Amazon EMR to process data using the broad ecosystem of Hadoop tools like Hive and Hue. We will also teach you how to create Big Data environments, work with Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, Amazon QuickSight, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Kinesis, and leverage best practices to design Big Data environments for security and cost-effectiveness.

## Objectives

### After taking this course, students will learn to:

* Fit AWS solutions inside a big data ecosystem
* Leverage Apache Hadoop in the context of Amazon EMR 
* Identify the components of an Amazon EMR cluster, then launch and configure an Amazon EMR cluster
* Use common programming frameworks available for Amazon EMR, including Hive, Pig, and streaming
* Improve the ease of use of Amazon EMR by using Hadoop User Experience (Hue) 
* Use in-memory analytics with Apache Spark on Amazon EMR 
* Choose appropriate AWS data storage options 
* Identify the benefits of using Amazon Kinesis for near real-time Big Data processing 
* Leverage Amazon Redshift to efficiently store and analyze data 
* Comprehend and manage costs and security for a Big Data solution 
* Identify options for ingesting, transferring, and compressing data 
* Leverage Amazon Athena for ad-hoc query analytics 
* Use AWS Glue to automate extract, transform, and load (ETL) workloads 
* Use visualization software to depict data and queries using Amazon QuickSight
