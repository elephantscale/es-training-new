## Overview

Scala may be the next wave in developer productivity. It is concise, object-oriented, functional, offers support for concurrency, but is compatible with Java and is JVM â€“ based. Scala is also a great platform for functional programming.  For these reasons, Scala has been attracting the interest of many organizations.

This training is targeted for programmers who need to get introduced to Scala. They may be new to Scala, they may be coming from a Java, Python, or even mainframe environment.

This training program is designed to help developers learn the language through guidance and hands-on training.

## Goals

* Learn one of the hottest languages
* Be a productive programmer with Scala
* Learn functional programming style
* Learn the best software development practices with Scala

## Audience

* Developers, architects

## Skill Level

* Introductory - Intermediate

## Duration

* Three days (can be customized)

## Format

* Lectures and hands-on labs (50% - 50%)

## Prerequisites

* Comfortable with a development in an object oriented environment
* Even though most people come to Scala from Java, any experienced developers are welcome

## Lab environment

### Local environment (Highly recommended)

We recommend attendees have a local environment setup.  Install the following:

* JDK 11 or higher
* Scala latest 2.x (2.13)
* Scala programming IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA (recommended), Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Cloud environment

A cloud based environment can be provided, if required.

### Students will need the following

* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
* A modern browser
