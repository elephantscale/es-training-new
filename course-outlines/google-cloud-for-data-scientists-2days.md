# Google Cloud for Data Scientists
2020 July 07

## Overview
Data Science is all the rage today, and Google is one of the major promoters of it. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is one of the leading platforms for Data Science.

In this course, the students will learn to do Data Science with Python,  and the capabilities of Google Cloud specific to Data Science

## What you will learn:
* Understand Google Cloud's features for Data Science
* Process of doing Data Science
* Using Google Compute Engine
* Using Google Cloud Storage
* Visualizing data using Google Data Studio
* Running SQL queries using Big Query
* Data analytics with Python
* Running Python code on Google Cloud

## Audience:
Data Analysts, Data Scientists

## Duration:
Three to four days depending on the agenda

## Format:
Lectures and hands*on labs. (50%, 50%)

## Prerequisites
* Interested in Data Science (data science overview is included as needed)
* Some basic knowledge of Python is highly recommended but not mandatory.  
  Our labs utilize Python language.  But Python is a very easy language to learn. So even you don't have previous exposure to Python, you will be able to complete the labs.
* Some programming experience is highly recommended

## Lab environment
Students need to have access to Google Cloud environment.  We encourage to use free credits provided by Google, if possible.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop
* Unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* A Google Cloud account is highly recommended.
