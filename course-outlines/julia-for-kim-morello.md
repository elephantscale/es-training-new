# Julia Programming

## Day 1 Introduction to Julia
### Motivation
* What niche is filled by Julia
* How can Julia help you with data analysis
* What you can expect to get out of this course
* Getting started with Julia&#39;s REPL
* Alternative environments for Julia development: Juno, IJulia and Sublime-IJulia
* The Julia ecosystem: documentation and package search
* Getting more help: Julia forums and Julia community
### Strings: Hello World
* Introduction to Julia REPL and batch execution via &quot;Hello World&quot;
* Julia String Types
### Scalar Types
* What is a variable? Why do we use a name and a type for it?
* Integers
* Floating point numbers
* Complex numbers
* Rational numbers
### Arrays
* Vectors
* Matrices
* Multi-dimensional arrays
* Heterogeneous arrays (cell arrays)
* Comprehensions
### Other Elementary Types
* Tuples
* Ranges
* Dictionaries
* Symbols
### Building Your Own Types
* Abstract types
* Composite types
* Parametric composite types
### Functions
* How to define a function in Julia
* Julia functions as methods operating on types
* Multiple dispatch
* How multiple dispatch differs from traditional object-oriented programming
* Parametric functions
* Functions changing their input

* Anonymous functions
* Optional function arguments
* Required function arguments
### Constructors
* Inner constructors
* Outer constructors
### Control Flow
* Compound expressions and scoping
* Conditional evaluation
* Loops
* Exception Handling
* Tasks
### Code Organization
* Modules
* Packages
### Metaprogramming
* Symbols
* Expressions
* Quoting
* Internal representation
* Parsing
* Evaluation
* Interpolation
## Day 2 - Julia for Data Science
### Reading and Writing Data
* Filesystem
* Data I/O
* Lower Level Data I/O
* Dataframes
### Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* DataFrames.jl
* Imputation of missing values
* Working with categorical data
### Distributions and Statistics
* Defining distributions
* Interface for evaluating and sampling from distributions
* Mean, variance and covariance
* Hypothesis testing
* Fitting statistical models: a linear regression example

### Graphics
* Specialist packages: Gadfly, Winston, Gaston, PyPlot, Plotly, Vega
* Introduction to Gadfly
* Interact and Gadfly
### Machine Learning
* Logistic regression
* Decision trees
* Random Forest
* Diagnostic plots
## Day 3: Computing with Julia
### Interfacing
* Python
* R
### Efficient coding in Julia
* Benchmarking
