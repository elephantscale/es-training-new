* (C) Elephant Scale
* 07-04-2022

## Overview

* Some say that 2021 will be the year of graph databases.

* GraphDB is a highly-efficient and robust graph database with RDF, SPARQL, and GraphQL support. This course introduces the participants to  GraphDB, RDF, and SPARQL, as well as topics such as setting up a repository, loading and working with data, tuning its performance, scaling, etc.

* This course is intended for software architects and engineers. It gives them a practical level of experience, achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% lab work. 

## Duration:
* 2-3 days

## Audience:
* Software Architects, Developers

## Skill level
* Introductory to Intermediate

## Prerequisites
- familiarity with any programming language
- be able to navigate Linux command line
- basic knowledge of command line Linux editors (VI / nano)

## Lab environment
* Working environment will be provided for students.  Students would only need an SSH client and a browse.
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. 
* Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
* Chrome browser
