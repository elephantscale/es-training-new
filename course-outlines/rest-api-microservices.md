February 15, 2022

A very important part of modern software development is the new discipline of Cloud-enabled microservices, and part of this is PAAS (Platform as a Service) which allows deploying such apps into production with the minimum effort. This course will introduce the participants into microservices,
concentrating on the REST API part.

The course is intended for software architects and engineers. It gives them a practical level of experience, achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% demo work with student’s participation.

Course objectives

Understand modern software development for stable fault-tolerant and scalable applications using microservices

Duration: 2 days

Audience: Developers, architects

Format: 50% lectures,  50% hands-on labs

Prerequisites :

Comfortable with command-line operations
Familiar with software development

Lab environment:

Zero Install: There is no need to install any software on students' machines! (although it is possible)
