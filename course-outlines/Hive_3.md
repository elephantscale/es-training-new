Hive is de-facto standard the SQL interface into Big Data. Today, it offers ACID tables,
storage requirements reduction by the factor of 2 with erasure coding, HBase integration with Phoenix,
and much more. 

However, in order to achieve efficiency, one must be familiar with the best practices of the HQL
language, compare different tools for looking at your data, whether it be Hive, Phoenix HBase, or plan Excel.

This course will explain the capabilities of Hive, HQL dialects, and best practices.
