April 13, 2023

## Course Description

* OpenAI with ChatGPT is eating the world with over a hundred million of users, and HuggingFace is the most popular library for Deep Learning, based on Transformer Neural Network, and containing inside Keras and PyTorch,
* This course introduces the students to Neural Networks, OpenAI, and AI in general. Then it goes into ChatGPT4 and teaches how humans should use it. This is called prompts engineering.
* Then it shows how to build applications on top of ChatGCP with the use of additional private company documents.
* Finally, the students learn about the use of the HuggingFace library to evaluate and integrate ChatGCP competitors.


## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Correctly use ChatGPT out of the box.
* Improve ChatGPT performance with "prompts."
* Further improve ChatGPT performance with machine-generated prompts and additional search services, such as Azure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Fine-tune open models with HuggingFace

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Beginner (day 1) to intermediate (days 2 and 3)

## Duration

* Three days

## Prerequisites

* General familiarity with machine learning


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
