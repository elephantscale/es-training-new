## Overview

Scala may be the next wave in developer productivity. It is concise, object-oriented, functional, offers support for concurrency, but is compatible with Java and is JVM – based. Scala is also a great platform for functional programming.  For these reasons, Scala has been attracting the interest of many organizations.

This training is for programmers who want to become productive with Scala. They must meet certain prerequisites, but their and our goal is Scala proficiency.

## Goals

* Learn one of the hottest languages
* Be a productive programmer with Scala
* Learn functional programming style
* Learn the best software development practices with Scala

## Audience

* Developers, architects

## Skill Level

* Introductory - Intermediate

## Duration

* Five days

## Format

* Lectures and hands-on labs (50% - 50%)

## Prerequisites

* At least one year of experience in software development
* Even though most people come to Scala from Java, any experienced developers are welcome

## Lab environment

### Local environment (Highly recommended)

We recommend attendees have a local environment setup. We will install it in class, but having the ones below is good.

* JDK 11 or higher
* Scala latest 2.x (2.13)
* Scala programming IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA (recommended), Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Cloud environment

A cloud based environment can be provided, if required.

### Students will need the following

* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
* A modern browser

### Assessment
* Throughout the course, we will have quizzes and exercises to assess the students'  progress. There will be a total of about 60 questions. 
* At the end the students will be presented with an overall quiz based on these questions. Optional: the students will be required to answer at least 80% of the questions correctly to pass the course.
