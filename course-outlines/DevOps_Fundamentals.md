# DevOps Fundamentals: Tools, Technologies, and Infrastructures
* (C) Elephant Scale
* 07-10-2024

## Overview

This is the perfect place to start for anyone looking to understand the practical aspects of DevOps and get a solid foundation in the subject. It will help you determine how best to apply DevOps practices within your organization.

We'll start off with an introduction to DevOps, its characteristics, and its benefits, and then we'll move on to the topics of continuous integration and continuous delivery. After that is when the real fun begins: you'll get a chance to put your new knowledge into practice with our hands-on labs, as you carry out your own deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and build your own OpsWorks stack.

The course then carries on to Introduction to Operations, since, once you've got your deployment up and running, you then need to know how to keep the operations running smoothly. That then leads to the final hands-on lab in the series, in which you'll learn how to monitor your operations in AWS by building a log aggregation system.


In this course, you will learn how and why the DevOps commitment to the entire lifecycle can enable the company to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world. You'll learn the principles and practices that enable Google engineers to make systems more scalable, reliable, and efficientâ€”lessons directly applicable to your organization.

* Learn how the DevOps philosophy can provide a holistic way to look at software development, deployment, and operations
* Explore the various tools, technologies, and vocabularies surrounding the continuous integration ecosystem
