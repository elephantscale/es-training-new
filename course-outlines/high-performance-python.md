# Writing High Performance Python Code
Â© Elephant Scale
October 21, 2020

## Overview
Python is a very popular, easy-to-use language that is widely adopted by developers, admins and data scientists.
However, here be dragons! Many people who pick up Python lack proper coding discipline, which results in code that 
is hard to maintain and that runs painfully slow.

This course teaches good Python coding discipline, how to avoid bottlenecks and to write  high performance code in Python

## What you will learn:
- Well-architected Python project
- Understand python execution architecture
- Learn to use profilers to spot bottlenecks
- Efficient search and retrieval on Collections
- Using numpy for fast numeric operations
- Compiling to native code

## Duration:
Half day to a day

## Audience:
Developers, data analysts, data scientists

## Skill level
Intermediate

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python language is recommended  

## Lab environment
- Students will need to have a Python development environment like Anaconda
- Instructions will be provided on how to set this up

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop
