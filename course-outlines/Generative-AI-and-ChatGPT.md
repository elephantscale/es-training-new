## Course Description

* OpenAI with ChatGPT is eating the world with millions of signed-up users, and HuggingFace is the most popular library for deep learning.
* This course surveys the background: Neural Networks, OpenAI, and AI in general. Then it goes into ChatGPT4, HuggingFace, and  OpenAI model and applies them to your work projects.
* The course also surveys ChatGPT competitors and derivative products.

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Master the background information for working with the Large Language Models (LLM): Generative AI, ChatGPT, etc.
* Formulate the expectations from a LLM implementation
* Know and be proficient with the tools of trade: HuggingFace, ChatGPT, etc.
* Use prompt engineering with the closed LLM that cannot be find-tuned
* Fine-tune open LLM
* Test the resulting product

## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know...
* How to understand the current state of the art in Deep Learning and AI
* How to put the claims of AI to the test
* How to utilize the existing results through transfer learning, pre-training, and fine-tuning.
* How to package your models for deployment.
* How to create machine learning pipelines and improve them in production.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers
