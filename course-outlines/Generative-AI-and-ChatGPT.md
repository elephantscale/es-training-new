## Course Description

* OpenAI with ChatGPT is eating the world with over a hundred million of users.
* This course introduces the students to Neural Networks, OpenAI, and AI in general. Then it goes into ChatGPT4 and teaches how humans should use it. This is called prompts engineering.
* Then it shows how to build applications on top of ChatGCP with the use of additional private company documents.
* Finally, the students learn about the use of the HuggingFace library to evaluate and integrate ChatGCP alternatives.


## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Correctly use ChatGPT out of the box.
* Improve ChatGPT performance with "prompts."
* Further improve ChatGPT performance with machine-generated prompts and additional search services, such as Azure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Fine-tune open models with HuggingFace
