October 28, 2024

* A very important part of modern software development is the new discipline of Cloud-enabled microservices, and part of this is PAAS (Platform as a Service) which allows deploying such apps into production with the minimum effort. This course will introduce the participants into microservices and to its implementation with various frameworks.

* The course is intended for software architects and engineers. It gives them a practical level of experience, achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% demo work with student's participation. 

### Course objectives

* Understand modern software development for stable fault-tolerant and scalable applications using microservices
* Learn about the 12 Factor App and how microservices enable it.
* Implement Microservices using containerization and container orchestration Technologies
* Learn Microservices Architectural Patterns

### Duration
* 2 days

### Audience
* Developers, architects
* Format: 50% lectures,  50% hands-on labs

### Prerequisites:

* Comfortable with command-line operations
* Familiar with software development

### Lab environment:

* Zero Install: There is no need to install any software on students' machines! (although it is possible)
