## Overview
This course will cover advanced topics of IBM QRadar SIEM. This is intended as the follow-up to IBM QRadar SIEM Foundations. Specifically, this will focus more on installation and configuring of the QRadar system, data management, advanced filtering, advanced searching with AQL, and analyzing a simulated large scale attack.

## Audience
Security professionals using QRadar, IT professionals, System Administrators responsible for implementing and configuring QRadar SIEM

## Skill Level
Advanced

## Duration
Two days

## Format
Lectures and hands on labs. (50%   50%)

## Prerequisites
* Required : IBM QRadar SIEM Foundations or Equivalent
* Recommended: Cybersecurity awareness, IT Security experience
* Recommended: Understanding of TCP/IP networking, Syslog
* Nice to have: Linux command line experience, common TCP/IP network protocols


## Lab environment
