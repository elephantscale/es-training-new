## Audience :
Developers, Architects

## Skill Level:
Introductory - Intermediate

## Duration :
Three days

## Format :
Lectures and hands on labs. (50%   50%)

## Prerequisites
* Recommended : Comfortable with Java programming language and Java development tools (Eclipse, Maven)  -  programming exercises are in Java
* Nice to have : Comfortable in Linux environment (be able to navigate Linux command line, run commands)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install : There is no need to install Kafka software on students' machines! 
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser 
* SSH client for your platform
 
## Detailed outline

### Introduction to Streaming Systems
*  Understanding Fast data
*  Streaming terminologies
*  Understanding at-least-once / at-most-once / exactly-once processing patterns
