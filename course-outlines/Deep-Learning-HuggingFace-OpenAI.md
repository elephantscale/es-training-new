## Course Description

* OpenAI with ChatGPT is eating the world with millions of signed-up users, and HuggingFace is the most popular library for deep learning.
* This course introduces the students to Neural Networks, OpenAI, and AI in general. Then it goes into ChatGPT4, HuggingFace, and  OpenAI model and applies them to your work projects.

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Classifying whole sentences:
  * Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not
* Classifying each word in a sentence:
  * Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)
* Generating text content:
  * Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words
* Extracting an answer from a text:
  * Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context
* Generating a new sentence from an input text:
  * Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text
* More
  * Generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image.
  
## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know...
* How to understand the current state of the art in Deep Learning and AI
