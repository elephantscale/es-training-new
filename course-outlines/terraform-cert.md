# Terraform Course Outline

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has revolutionized application deployment by enabling infrastructure configuration through code rather than manual processes. Terraform, an open-source tool, has emerged as a leading IaC solution, surpassing proprietary cloud implementations such as AWS CloudFormation. Many major cloud providers, including Google Cloud, have adopted Terraform, solidifying its status as an industry standard.

Terraform's declarative and idempotent approach ensures predictable and repeatable infrastructure deployments across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle Cloud, VMware, OpenStack, and more.
