* Combined, Understand how to be a cyber threat hunter.

* Multiple labs (3-4).  Each labs will be presented in each track, software, hardware, and the cloud.

### Skill Level

* The audience is expected to have IT experience but only minimal actual cybersecurity experience.   The goal is to graduate cyber security warriors in two days.  Of course, that is unlikely.  However, we want to put them fully on that path.
* The work will be done in Windows environment.
* There will be three tracks: software, hardware, and the cloud.
* The class will be very hands-on, with 80% hands-on lab, and 20% presentation/lecture.
