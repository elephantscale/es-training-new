## Course Description

* This course covers the essentials of **Spring Cloud** for building microservices architectures. You will learn about configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, routing, messaging, and distributed tracing. Additionally, you will explore how to build resilient, scalable applications by integrating Spring Cloud components with Docker and Kubernetes. This course emphasizes hands-on labs to give you the practical skills needed to architect, deploy, and manage Spring Cloud applications in a production environment.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will:
* Understand the core components of Spring Cloud.
* Manage configuration using Spring Cloud Config and Vault.
* Implement service discovery with Eureka, Consul, and Zookeeper.
* Build resilient applications using Hystrix and Resilience4j circuit breakers.
* Route and manage API traffic with Spring Cloud Gateway.
* Implement distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.
* Set up continuous integration pipelines with Jenkins and Spring Cloud Contract.
* Deploy microservices using Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Lab**: Implement routing rules and custom filters using Spring Cloud Gateway.

### Tracing

#### Spring Cloud Sleuth
- Distributed tracing and log correlation across microservices.
- **Lab**: Implement distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth to track requests across services.

#### Zipkin
- Trace collection, dependency graphs, and trace visualization.
- **Lab**: Use Zipkin to collect, analyze, and visualize traces in your microservices architecture.

### CI Pipelines and Testing

#### Continuous Integration (CI) Tools
- Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Travis CI integration.
- **Lab**: Set up a CI pipeline with Jenkins for automated testing and deployment of microservices.

#### Testing Strategies
- Unit, integration, contract, and end-to-end testing.
- **Lab**: Implement contract testing using Spring Cloud Contract to ensure compatibility between microservices.

### Docker and Kubernetes

#### Docker
- Microservices containerization and image management.
