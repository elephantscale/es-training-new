## Overview
 
* Scala may be the next wave in developer productivity. It is concise, object-oriented, functional, offers support for concurrency, but is compatible with Java and is JVM – based. For this reason, Scala has been attracting the interest of many programming shops. However, these advantages are only possible through an effort of study. The Scala Programming course is designed to help this process through hands-on training.
* This course is teaching Scala on the intermediate and advanced levels. It is targeted for developers who either have the basic knowledge of Scala or have a solid foundation of Java.
* This course teaches how to understand the essence of Scala and write functional programming software that is efficient and “scalaesque” enough.
