## Overview

* As the technological equivalent of discovering fire in the realm of data analysis, Machine Learning (ML) is
  revolutionizing the approach to data interpretation and decision-making processes across industries. This course, as a
  continuation of Module 1, delves deeper into the intricate world of ML, focusing on both the theoretical underpinnings
  and practical applications of various algorithms. Designed for individuals with a foundational understanding of
  Python, NumPy, and Pandas, this course aims to equip participants with the skills to implement ML algorithms for
  real-world problem-solving.

* Targeted at software engineers, data scientists, and analytics professionals, the course structure is meticulously
  crafted to balance theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, ensuring about 50% of the time is devoted to
  engaging demonstrations and interactive labs where students actively participate.

## Benefits

* By completing this course, participants will:

    - Understand and apply a wide array of ML algorithms for regression, classification, and clustering problems.
    - Master the techniques for assessing the performance of ML models.
    - Gain insights into neural networks and how they can be used for pattern recognition and natural language
      processing.
    - Learn strategies for improving model performance through resampling and algorithm tuning.
    - Complete a Capstone project, where they will build their own AI investor using Python, applying a data-driven
      approach to the stock market.

## Course Outline:

### Session 1: Regression Algorithms in Machine Learning

* Focus on linear and non-linear regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, LASSO, Elastic Net
  Regression, and more.
* Introduction to decision trees and their application in regression problems.

### Session 2: Classification Algorithms

* Comprehensive coverage of linear and non-linear classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Linear
  Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.

### Session 3: Unsupervised Learning and Clustering

* Exploration of unsupervised learning techniques with a focus on clustering methods like k-Means and hierarchical
  clustering.
* A challenge lab where students build a Churn prediction algorithm.

### Session 4: Assessing Model Performance

* Understanding and applying various metrics to evaluate the performance of ML models, including RMSE, MAE, MSE, R2,
  ROC, and AUC.

### Session 5: Neural Networks

* Deep dive into the structure and functioning of neural networks, including training techniques and applications in
  pattern recognition and natural language processing.

### Session 6: Enhancing Model Performance

* Techniques for algorithm tuning, including random search and grid search parameter tuning.
* Guidelines for finalizing models for deployment using serialization tools like pickle and joblib.

### Session 7: Review, Summary, & Capstone Project

* Consolidation of learned concepts through a review of models and business cases.
* Capstone Project where students create an AI investor tailored to their strategy preference, applying a comprehensive
  data-driven approach to the stock market.

### Session 8: Outage prediction

* Up until now, we have learned predicting desirable events. In this section, special attention is given to predicting undesirable events, or anomalies.
* The idea here is to find the data patterns, as above, but then we switch to detecting anomalous points that do not fit the pattern and that portend danger.
* This is done using the Random Cut Forest (RFC) and similar algorithms.
* The approach is further enhanced by applying statistical analysis to data following these guidelines: https://www.griddynamics.com/solutions/anomaly-detection.
* This addition session teaches the use of machine learning for outage prediction. 
* Capstone project will include customer-supplied data.
* Length: two or three sessions of four hours each.
