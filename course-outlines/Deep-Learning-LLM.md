## Course Description

* Large Language Models (LLM) are taking the world by storm.
* HuggingFace provides libraries and a place to put LLMs in production.
* This course introduces the students to AI, Neural Networks, and LLMs. 

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Evaluate LLM models
* Put the models in production
* Use HuggingFace as a possible implementation platform

## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know...
* How to understand the current state of the art in Deep Learning and AI
* How to put the claims of AI to the test
* How to utilize the existing results through transfer learning, pre-training, and fine-tuning.
* How to package your models for deployment.
* How to create machine learning pipelines and improve them in production.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate

## Duration
* Two days

## Prerequisites
