## Overview

* Storytelling with Data teaches you the fundamentals of data visualization and how to communicate effectively with data. You'll discover the power of storytelling and the way to make data a pivotal point in your story. The lessons in this illuminative text are grounded in theory, but made accessible through numerous real-world examples—ready for immediate application to your next graph or presentation.

* Storytelling is not an inherent skill, especially when it comes to data visualization, and the tools at our disposal don't make it any easier. This book demonstrates how to go beyond conventional tools to reach the root of your data, and how to use your data to create an engaging, informative, compelling story. Specifically, you'll learn how to:

  * Understand the importance of context and audience

  * Determine the appropriate type of graph for your situation

  * Recognize and eliminate the clutter clouding your information

  * Direct your audience's attention to the most important parts of your data

  * Think like a designer and utilize concepts of design in data visualization

  * Leverage the power of storytelling to help your message resonate with your audience
  
* It is assumed that the participants already know and use tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Looker.  We will not teach the technical aspect of using those visualization tools but concentrate on the art. 

## Duration: 

* 4-6 hours

## Audience: 
* Electronics Arts Data Analysts

### Introducing the presenter
*  Who is the presenter and why you should trust him

### Aspects/Drivers

* Business Understanding
  * Before you rush to use a visualisation tool, pause and decide what you want to say
* Buy in & Persuasion
  * Who is your audience, and what do you want to tell them?
* Data Storytelling
  * People are not born storytellers, but you can become one 

### Psychology/Expressive

* "Who (says) What (to) Whom (in) Which Channel (with) What Effect”
* Merrill and Reid Social Styles-Awareness drive
* Bridging the gap between Humans and Data-Visualization way
* Cognitive behaviour analysis


### Additional background from the psychology perspective

* * The Merrill typography is a commercialized version of the four factor behavioral styles that have been around since Hippocrates but was formalized into psychology by Prof William Moulton Marston and refined at the University of Minnesota as diagnostic instrument.
  * The importance of a behavioral style is that it represents a filter a person uses in a specific environment based on the demands of that environment. It is a learned pattern of adaptive responses that changes over time in response to the environment.
  * The commercialized versions tend to treat it like a personality test, downplaying the nuances of the analysis in order to get people to buy it.
  * The important aspect of this is that people will prioritize data based in part on their style. The presentation of data has to take this into account – knowing your audience – in order to be effective.

### Technical/Analytical

* Data Science,Many Skills
* Follow the Data
  * Where to store it, how to process?
* Rows and Columns, Variables, Attributes
* Pictures vs Numbers
  * What to do when pictures are too large and too slow
* Big Data? Big Deal!
  * Overview of Big Data tools with examples and exercises
* init(),service(),destroy()
  * [MK] Need more details on this

### Additional background from the psychology perspective

* The human visual system is much more highly developed than other sensory processing systems. Data that requires reading and processing is harder to ingest and understand than data depicted visually. This becomes more important as the volume of data and dimensions of analysis increase
* However, choosing the correct form of visual presentation can be though of as story telling with pictures – there is a substantial body of work on optimizing visual presentations of data (usability studies)

### Amiable/Philosophy

* Types of Stories
* Why do we tell stories?
* How to tell great stories?
* Storytelling process

### Additional background from the psychology perspective

* There are several universal discourse modes: narrative, exposition, reporting… etc. We tend to shift between modes in a discourse in order to communicate effectively, often in response to our listener not understanding what we are communicating.
* Narrative is the first mode learned by all people since it is actually tied to processing in the visual system. It is also the mode we tend to revert to in order to clarify or consolidate data.
* From a cognitive perspective, short term memory can only absorb so much information. In a class, students reach a threshold of retention after which no new information is learned.
* The brain has to consolidate all of the new information into a “clump” or structure to put it into long term memory and to free up short term memory for new information.
* Since this mechanism is not employed when processing a story, the insertion of stories into a class gives students a chance to consolidate what they have been taught, as well as providing a context for consolidation. The story becomes an exemplar of the presented material, sort of like a mental index entry.
* The most effective mechanism for learning is to do something that requires the application of material. In some cases this is not possible, but following a narrative has a similar effect.
