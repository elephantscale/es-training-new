# Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Overview
We live in an era of so much data - a lot of it is text (emails, tweets, customer tickets, Yelp reviews, product reviews ..etc.)

In the field of AI, there is a revolution going on in the past few years.  The researchers from companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu has come up with break through algorithms that can understand text data more than ever before.

The applications are wide ranging, including understanding documents, processing customer service tickets and analyzing reviews.

In this course, we will teach how to handle text data using modern AI technologies.


## What you will learn:
- How to prepare text for machine learning
- Steming,  tokenizing and filtering stop words in text
- Analyzing documents using word-frequency, bag-of-words techniques
- Visualizing text data
- Classic toolsets for text processign : NLTK, Textblob, TF-IDF
- Naive Bayes for text classifications
- Modern techniques for text : Spacy, Word2Vec
- Topic modeling with Gensim
- Neural Network frameworks : Tensorflow & Keras
- NN models for text processing: LSTM, RNN
- Modern NN models for text processing: ELMO, ULMFIT, BERT


## Duration:
Four Days

## Audience:
Developers, Data analysts, data scientists

## Skill level
Introductory to Intermediate

## Industry Use Cases Covered
We will study and solve some of most common industry use cases; listed below

* Determining if a text message is a spam (Telco)
* Sentiment analysis of Tweets (Social)
* IMDB Movie ratings and reviews analysis

## Prerequisites
- Programming background
- Basic knowledge of Python language and Jupyter notebooks is recommended.  
Even if you haven't done any Python programming, Python is such an easy language to learn quickly.  We will provide Python resources.


## Lab environment
- Cloud based lab environment will be provided to students, no need to install anything on the laptop

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser
