# Python Testing


This course is an overview of how to develop and implement unit tests and integration tests, how to use automated test tools to support Python development. Modern code development best practices include the use of automated test driven development (TDD) and behavior driven development (BDD) methodologies to improve programmer productivity and code quality.

The course covers the basics of test development emphasizing the techniques used to develop good tests, and the use of the Python Unittest and Behave testing tools to automate unit testing and acceptance testing.
