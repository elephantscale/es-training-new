# SRE - Site Reliability Engineering
* (C) Elephant Scale
* 02-22-2022

## Overview

The overwhelming majority of a software system's lifespan is spent in use, 
not in design or implementation. 
So, why does conventional wisdom insist that software engineers focus primarily on the design and development of large-scale computing systems?

In this course, you will learn how and why the DevOps commitment to the entire lifecycle can enable the company to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world. You'll learn the principles and practices that enable Google engineers to make systems more scalable, reliable, and efficientâ€”lessons directly applicable to your organization.
