* Spark SQL
* Modern data formats and Spark
* Spark API

## Duration

Two Days

## Audience

Developers, Data analysts and business analysts

## Skill level

Introductory to Intermediate

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Python language and Jupyter notebooks is preferred but not mandatory
Even if you haven't done any Python programming, Python is such an easy language to learn quickly.  We will provide Python resources.
