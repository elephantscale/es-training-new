## About the Course

ElasticSearch is one of the leading search platforms. 
With LogStash, added for log collection, and Kibana for the dashboard, it becomes ELK, a popular log collection and analysis tool. 
New features include security, monitoring, and machine learning. All together, these components provide a platform for industrial search applications, and all of them are covered in this course.
