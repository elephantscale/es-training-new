# Introduction to Apache Spark

## Overview

We are living in an era of 'big data'.  And being able to analyze and process big data is very vital for enterprises.

Spark is a popular platform for analyzing big data.

This course introduces Apache Spark to students.

This class is taught with Python language and using Jupyter environment

## What you will learn:
*	Spark ecosystem
*	Spark Shell
*	Spark Data structures (RDD / Dataframe / Dataset)
*	Spark SQL
*	Modern data formats and Spark
*	Spark API
*	Spark & Hadoop & Hive
*	Spark ML overview
*	GraphX
*	Spark Streaming


## Duration:
Three Days

## Audience:
Developers, Data analysts and business analysts

## Skill level
Introductory to Intermediate

## Prerequisites
*  Basic knowledge of Python language and Jupyter notebooks is preferred but not mandatory.  
Even if you haven't done any Python programming, Python is such an easy language to learn quickly.  We will provide Python resources.

## Lab environment
*  Cloud based lab environment will be provided to students, no need to install anything on the laptop

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser
