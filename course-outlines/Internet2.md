* This course covers the best practices of building Computationally- and Data-intensive workflows for cloud-based platforms. It is concerned with the modern cloud architectures as they apply to Amazon, Azure, and Google clouds. The course covers these topics:

    - Introduction to the cloud (1 hour)
    - IAM user management (4 hour)
    - Cloud storage and databases (3 hours)
    - Networking and Data Movement (2 hours)
    - Containerization (4 hours)
    - Computing, elasticity, and scaling (6 hours)
    - Performance optimization (2 hours)
    - Cost management (4 hours)
    - Architecting in the cloud (2 hours)
    - AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning (4 hours)
    - Data Analytics with Hadoop and Spark (4 hours)
    - Multi-cloud Infrastructure-as-code (IAS) (2 hours)
    - Workflow and workflow management (2 hours)
    
* The course is multi-cloud. It refers to general cloud architecting principles, and their implementation in the three major clouds.

### Labs
* For the labs, students will be provided with accounts on Qwiklabs covering AWS and GCP
* Students' own cloud accounts are optional but highly recommended
* Azure labs - TBD
