# Intro to Deep Learning With TensorFlow & Keras

## Overview

The abundance of data and affordable cloud scale has led to an explosion of interest in Deep Learning. Google has open sourced a library called TensorFlow which has become the de-facto standard, allowing state-of-the-art machine learning done at scale, complete with GPU-based acceleration.

This course introduces Deep Learning concepts and TensorFlow and Keras libraries to students.

## What you will learn:
- Deep Learning concepts
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Create neural networks with Tensorflow and Keras
- Learn to use tools like Tensorboard to help with training neural networks
- We will build neural networks to solve the following problems
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Computer vision / Image analytics


## Duration:
Two Days

## Audience:
Developers, Data analysts, data scientists

## Skill level 
Introductory to Intermediate

## Industry Use Cases Covered
We will study and solve some of most common industry use cases; listed below

* Finance
  - Predicting loan defaults at Prosper
  - Predicting house prices
* Health care
  - Predicting diabetes outcome
* Customer service
  - Predicting customer turnover
* Computer vision
  - Various image analysis

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python language and Jupyter notebooks is assumed.  
Even if you haven't done any Python programming, Python is such an easy language to learn quickly.  We will provide Python resources.


## Lab environment
- Cloud based lab environment will be provided to students, no need to install anything on the laptop

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser 
* SSH client for your platform
