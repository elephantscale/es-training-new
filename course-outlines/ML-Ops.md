July 1, 2021

## Overview

Machine Learning and AI represent a great opportunity. All too often, taking a Machine Learning
prototype to production makes a difference between success and failure in the AI strategy of a company.
This need is fulfilled by Machine Learning Engineers who apply the rules of DevOps to AI.

This course teaches how to take Machine Learning and AI and reduce it to practice. Thus, the name: ML Ops.

## Audience
Developers, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level
Introductory - Intermediate

## Duration
Three days

## Format
Lectures and hands-on labs (50% - 50%)

## Prerequisites

* Comfortable developing code in the target environment


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
