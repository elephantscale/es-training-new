# Machine Learning and MLOps with Go

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

October 22, 2021


## Overview

* In Machine Learning, there are two trends: multiple tools and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps.) 
* Go is a language created by Google for performance. It is often explained as "C for the 21-st century."
* MLOps can be explained as follows.
  * Machine Learning and AI represent a great opportunity. All too often, taking a Machine Learning
  prototype to production makes a difference between success and failure in the AI strategy of a company.
  This need is fulfilled by Machine Learning Engineers who apply the rules of DevOps to AI.
* This course teaches Machine Learning with Go. It also teaches how to take Machine Learning and AI and reduce it to practice.
