## Overview

Containerization has taken the IT world by storm, in the last few years. Large software houses, starting from Google and Amazon, are running significant portions of their production load in containers.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

This course introduces the students to Docker and then  Kubernetes, its architecture, its use in production, and its best practices.

## What You Will Learn

* Kubernetes concepts and architecture
* Orchestrating Docker containers with Kubernetes
* Labels and selectors
* Deploying resilient, scalable services
* Kubernetes volumes
* Kubernetes networking
* security

## Duration

3 days

## Audience

Developers, architects, admins

## Format

50% lectures, 50% hands-on labs.

## Prerequisites

* Must-have: comfortable with Linux environment.
* Familiar with software development

## Lab environment

A cloud based lab environment will be provided.

## Students will need the following

* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser
* SSH client for your platform
