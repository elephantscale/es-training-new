# Quantum Computing for Classical Programmers
© Elephant Scale

January 23, 2023

## Overview

* As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has arisen to train a cohort of
  quantum programmers, many of whom have been developing classical computer programs for most of
  their careers.

* The course introduces computer scientists, physicists, and engineers to quantum
  algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.

## Benefits

* After taking the course, participants will be able to

  - Explain the principles of quantum computing and quantum algorithms.
  - Apply quantum algorithms to solve problems in chemistry, finance, and machine learning.
  - Be ready for the quantum computing revolution and estimate its feasibility for their
    applications.

## Duration:

* Two days

## Audience:
* computer scientists, physicists, and engineers.
