# AI for Image Processing

## Overview

In the last few years, AI algorithms for image analysis have made tremendous progress.  This is mainly due to the abundance of data,  affordable computing and exceptional libraries. Google has open sourced a library called TensorFlow which has become the de facto standard, allowing state of the art machine learning done at scale, complete with GPU based acceleration.

This course introduces Deep Learning concepts and TensorFlow and Keras libraries to students.

## What you will learn:
*  Deep Learning concepts
*  TensorFlow and Keras
*  Create neural networks with Tensorflow and Keras
*  Learn to use tools like Tensorboard to help with training neural networks
*  Deep Neural Networks
*  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
*  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
*  Auto Encoders


## Duration:
Three Days

## Audience:
