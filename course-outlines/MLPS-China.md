## Overview
The MLPS (2.0) stands for Multi-level Protection for Cybersecurity.

CSL Article 21 it states: 

    The State has implemented a cybersecurity multi-level protection scheme. 
    Network operators must perform the following security protection duties according
    to the requirements of the cybersecurity multi-level protection scheme 
    to ensure the network is free from interference, damage, or unauthorised access,
    and to prevent network data leaks, theft, or falsification. 

This course will introduce the participants to the basics of implementation and 
maintenance of the compliance with the regulations.

### What is MLPS 2.0?

* CSL connection 
    - As an administrative regulation based on CSL Article - 21, 
    the Regulations on Multi-level Protection for Cybersecurity
    is an important supporting regulation.
* "Network" instead of system
    - The term "network" as defined in
    the MLPS Regulation refers to a system comprised of computers, other
    information terminals and related equipment that follows certain rules
    and procedures for gathering, storing, transmitting, exchanging and
    processing information.
* Enhanced enforcement
    - According the MLPS Regulation, the national cyberspace administration 
    are responsible for comprehensively planning and coordinating cybersecurity efforts, 
    while public security organs are responsible for supervision and management of the
    cybersecurity multi-level protection scheme.          

* Network Operators' Security Protection Obligations
    - The MLPS Regulation
    provides more detailed requirements regarding the different levels of security obligations for network
    operators.
    - MLPS Regulation Article 20 specifies eleven general security protection obligations that network operators
    shall meet
    - MLPS Regulation Article 21 specifies eight advanced security protection obligations that network operators
     should comply with for networks graded level 3 or above
* Implementation Guideline
    - Specify the roles and responsibilities of relevant parties
  - Basic processes and implementation requirements across the multi-level protection implementation efforts. The basic processes of
    - grading and filing
    - security planning
    - security design and implementation
    - security operations and maintenance
    - emergency response and protection
    - termination of grading objects
    
* Grading Guideline
 
    – Specify the grading method and process for cybersecurity multi-level protection
    - specific grading objects
       - cloud computing platforms
       - mobile Internet,
       - Internet of things
       - big data
       - industrial control systems
       
* Filing Rules
  - Processes for filing acceptance
  - Filing review and filing management
  - Guide and strengthen multi-level protection filings
  
* Baseline

   - Specify general security requirements and extended security requirements for grading objects of levels 1 – 4
   - security control requirements, which are applicable to the security implementation and supervision of non-secret
grading objects

* Technical Requirements
   - requirements for multi-level protection security design for grading objects
of levels 1 – 4
   - act as guidance for system operation organisations
   - carry out the design and implementation of technical security for multi-level protection
   - basis for information security departments to 
     - supervise
     - inspect
     - instruct
      
* Evaluation Requirements 
   - Specify general security evaluation requirements for grading objects of levels 1 – 4
   - extended security evaluation requirements for grading objects related to new technologies
       - mobile Internet
       - big data
       - cloud computing platforms
       - Internet of things
        - industrial control systems.           
* Relationship with existing regulations
  from Public Security Organs
* Relationship with Critical Information
  Infrastructure protection
  
* MLPS Key Enhancements
