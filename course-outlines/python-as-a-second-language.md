## Overview

* Python has recently become the most popular language.  It excels at data science,
artificial intelligence, and other tasks but is also an outstanding language for
web programming and general application development.  

  * This is a Python course for programmers comfortable with another language. 
  * Helps beginners to Python become comfortable with language basics and getting started with Python.
  * Takes those moving beyond Python language basics to doing analytics and application development in Python.
  * Teaches doing Machine Learning using popular SciKit-Learn package in Python language.
