# Terraform Intro 1-day
Â© Elephant Scale

April 15, 2025

## Overview

* IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is one of the most important developments in application
deployment in many years. It means that instead of manually configuring your hardware and software
infrastructure, you describe all this configuration as code.

* While every cloud gives you their implementation of it, and while Amazon heavily promotes
their version called CloudFormation, Terraform is a maverick who appeared on the scene a few years ago and
became more popular than all other IaC implementations. Recently, Google recognized the superiority of Terraform and started using that instead of their tool. This speaks to the importance of learning Terraform.

* Terraform is open source and can be used on any cloud provider, 
such as Amazon Web Services, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, Linode, Microsoft Azure, 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, VMware vSphere, OpenStack, and many others. 

* Terraform is declarative and idempotent. These are good design principles, 
and many competitors have also implemented Terraform ideas, making Terraform a de facto standard.
