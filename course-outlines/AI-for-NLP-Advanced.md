# Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Advanced

## Overview
We live in an era of so much data - and a lot of it is text (emails, tweets, customer tickets, Yelp reviews, product reviews, etc.)

In the field of AI, there is a revolution going on in the past few years.  The researchers from companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu have come up with break-through technologies that work with text based on its meaning and not the keywords in it.

The applications are wide ranging, including understanding documents, processing customer service tickets and analyzing reviews.

In this course, we will give you practical skill in handling text with modern AI NLP technologies.


## What you will learn:
- Modern techniques for text: Spacy, Word2Vec
- Topic modeling with Gensim
- Neural Network frameworks: Tensorflow & Keras
- NN models for text processing: LSTM, RNN
- Modern NN models for text processing: ELMO, ULMFIT, BERT
- Practical skills in builing BERT model
- Hugging Face Library


## Duration:
Three Days

## Audience:
Developers, Data analysts, data scientists

## Skill level
Intermediate to Advanced

## Industry Use Cases Covered
We will study and solve some of most common industry use cases; listed below

* Sentiment analysis of Tweets (Social)
* IMDB Movie ratings and reviews analysis

## Prerequisites
- Programming background
- Basic knowledge of Python language and Jupyter notebooks is recommended.  
Even if you haven't done any Python programming, Python is such an easy language to learn quickly.  We will provide Python resources.


## Lab environment
- Cloud based lab environment will be provided to students, no need to install anything on the laptop

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
* Chrome browser
