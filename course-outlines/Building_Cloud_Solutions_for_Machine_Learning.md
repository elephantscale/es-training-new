Â© Elephant Scale

September 14, 2020

* This course covers the best practices of building Machine Learning and High Performance
systems in the cloud-based application. It is concerned with the modern cloud architectures 
as they apply to Amazon, Azure, and Google clouds. The course covers these topics:
    
    * IAM user management
    * Cloud storage and databases
    * Computing, elasticity, and scaling
    * Performance optimization
    * Cost management
    * Networking and Data Movement
    * Containerization
    * Architecting in the cloud
    * Secure environment
    * AI, Deep Learning, Machine Learning
    * Data Analytics with Hadoop and Spark
    * Workflow and workflow management        
    * Multi-cloud Infrastructure-as-code (IAS) with  Terraform
        
* The course is multi-cloud. It refers to general cloud architecting principles,
 and their implementation in the three major clouds.

* Labs
    * For the labs, ideally, the students should come with their own cloud account
    * AWS, GCP, Azure (select the ones that you need)
    * Optionally some labs may be on Qwiklabs or on temporary accounts provided for training
