# Introduction to COBOL
© Elephant Scale
Jan. 1, 2025


## Overview

* This is a comprehensive program to provide developers with a strong foundation in COBOL programming with an emphasis on how COBOL is designed and the architecture of COBOL applications.  The four divisions of a COBOL program and essential concepts like data types, variables, and control structures are introduced and participants will learn to handle basic file operations, write modular code, and implement simple input/output procedures.
* The current COBOL context, the role COBOL based legacy applications play in enterprise environments is discussed at length since most students will be working with legacy COBOL, either in a support programming role, adapting COBOL code to new environments or migrating COBOL applications into other technologies.
* Through hands-on exercises and a capstone project, learners will gain practical experience in writing and debugging COBOL programs. The course is designed to be very hands-on with extensive labs, exercises and challenge problems

## Audience
* Developers who already have a background in programming.

## Duration
* 5 days

## Format
* Lectures and hands-on labs. (50%, 50%)

## Prerequisites

 * Background in programming

## Lab environment

* TBD

## Detailed Outline

### Unit 1: COBOL Fundamentals

* Origins and evolution of COBOL
* COBOL in enterprise systems, where it is used today
* Maintaining, migrating and enhancing legacy COBOL applications
* Types and versions of COBOL in use 
* Installation of COBOL compilers, IDE and environments for the labs
* Setting up a COBOL project, writing, compiling, and running a COBOL program

### Unit 2: COBOL Program Structure

* The historical and practical reasons for COBOL divisions
* Identification Division: Purpose, structure, and syntax
* Environment Division: Configuring the runtime environment
* Data Division: Defining data storage
* Procedure Division: Writing executable code
* Variations of the program structure in legacy systems
* Migrating between COBOL dialects, systems and versions

* ### Unit 3: Data and Variables
* Syntax conventions: Keywords, comments, and formatting
* Program compilation, linking  and debugging
* COBOL Data Types and Variables
  * Numeric, alphanumeric, and alphabetic data types
  * Internal representations and storage considerations
* Working with Level Numbers
  * Hierarchy of data definitions using level numbers
  * Differentiating group and elementary items
* Picture Clauses and Value Clauses
  * Defining data formats with PIC (e.g., X, 9, V, S)
  * Initializing variables using the VALUE clause
* Constants and Literals
  * Numeric, string, and figurative constants (e.g., ZERO, SPACE)
* Tables and Arrays
  * Basics of defining single-dimensional tables with OCCURS
  * Accessing elements using subscripts
