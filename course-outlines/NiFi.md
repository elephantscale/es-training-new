Â© Elephant Scale

June 15, 2021

## Overview

* This three-day hands-on training course provides the fundamental concepts and experience necessary to automate the ingest, flow, transformation, and egress of data using Apache NiFi. 
* Along with gaining a grasp of the key features, concepts, and benefits of NiFi, participants will create and run NiFi dataflows for a variety of scenarios. 
* Students will gain expertise using processors, connections, and process groups, and will use NiFi Expression Language to control the flow of data from various sources to multiple destinations. 
* Participants will monitor dataflows, examine progress of data through a dataflow, and connect dataflows to external systems such as Kafka and HDFS. 
* After taking this course, participants will have key knowledge and expertise for configuring and managing data ingestion, movement, and transformation scenarios for the enterprise.





## Objectives:
* Understand the role of Apache NiFi and MiNiFi in the Cloudera DataFlow platform
* Describe NiFi's architecture, including standalone and clustered configurations
* Use key features, including FlowFiles, processors, process groups, controllers, and connections, to define a NiFi dataflow
* Navigate, configure dataflows, and use dataflow information with the NiFi User Interface
* Trace the life of data, its origin, transformation, and destination, using data provenance
* Organize and simplify dataflows
* Manage dataflow versions using the NiFi Registry
* Use the NiFi Expression Language to control dataflows
* Implement dataflow optimization methods and available monitoring and reporting features
* Connect dataflows with other systems, such as Kafka and HDFS
* Describe aspects of NiFi security


## Duration:
* Three Days

## Audience
* Developers  & Administrators

## Prerequisites

* comfortable in Java programming language (navigate Linux command line , edit files with vi / nano)
