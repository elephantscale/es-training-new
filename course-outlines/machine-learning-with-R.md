Introduction to Machine Learning with R
2020 Feb 10
Overview
Machine Learning (ML) is changing the world. To use ML effectively, one needs to understand the algorithms and how to utilize them. This course provides an introduction to the most popular machine learning algorithms.
R is a very popular, open-source environment for statistical computing, data analytics, and graphics. This course introduces R programming language to students. This course teaches doing Machine Learning using the popular R language.
This course teaches Machine Learning from a practical perspective. In-depth coverage of Math / Stats is beyond the scope of this course.
