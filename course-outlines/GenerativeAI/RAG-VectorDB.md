# Generative AI with RAG and VectorDB

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

April 14, 2024

## Course Description

* Generative AI with Large Language Models (LLM) opens ways to building smart applications as never before. 
* The most popular architecture for that is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG.) RAG systems are built with semantic search. 
* In this course, the students learn how build the RAG systems. 
  * For semantic component we use VectorDB from DataStax. 
  * For the Generative AI, we have a choice of LLMs, such as ChatGPT or local LLama for HIPAA compliance.
  * For the implementation, we teach the best cloud and cloud architecture for your project.

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an LLM in a correct way.
* Script talking to LLM for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine (VectorDB or Pinecone.)
* Structure the flow of conversation with LLM about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Three days
* Can be broken into introduction and advanced parts of appropriate length

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
