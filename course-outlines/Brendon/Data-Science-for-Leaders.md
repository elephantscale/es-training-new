# Data Science for Leaders

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale
August 14, 2022

## Course Description

* This course allows business leaders to grasp how to extract value from data.
Leaving out the hype, it teaches how the use of modern data science techniques could translate to a leap forward in progress or a significant competitive advantage. 
Whether you are building or buying "AI-powered" solutions, it teaches how your organization could benefit from machine learning.

* No coding or complex math. This is not a hands-on course. We set out to explain all of the fundamental concepts you'll need in plain English.

## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know:
* What models are, how they work, and how they fit in the overall picture of machine learning (ML) and data science.
* Understand the use of terminology ("AI", "deep learning", etc.) with plain and simple explanations.
* Fair warning: NO hands-on model development (NO code & NO complex formulas)
* How to *identifying* and *quantifying* machine learning opportunities.
* How to understand ML as a capability that can benefit any business.

## Audience
* Developers, team leads, project managers
