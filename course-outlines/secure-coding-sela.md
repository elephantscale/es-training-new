# Secure Coding

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

August 2, 2022

## Overview

* Cybersecurity has risen to the top priority discussion items, and it is the subject of international relations.
  The number of ransomware attacks doubled in the past year, and other attacks are on the rise.
* This course teaches a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. It starts with threat modeling, creating the lay of the land.
  It then continues with common attacks, with the principles of designing secure multi-layer systems, and goes into the details
  of secure coding for the target languages.
* Also included are securing runtime environments and modern security frameworks.

## Audience
* Developers, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level
* Introductory - Intermediate

## Learning objectives

* Establish the overall security landscape
* Become cognizant in the best security practices for software application development
* Familiarize yourself with common attacks and how the best practices help protect against these

## You will learn to
* Do threat modeling and create a lay of the land for what you need to defend
* Learn about common attacks, with real-world labs, and find ways to defend against them
* Learn good practices and coding standards to make your software more secure and less vulnerable to attacks
* Use new and upcoming frameworks for designing your software to be secure be default


## Duration
* Two days

## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)

## Prerequisites
* Recommended: Cybersecurity awareness
* Comfortable developing code in the target environment


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser

## Detailed outline

### Threat modeling

* Honey pots
* Avoiding SQL injection
* Parametrizing queries/Prepared statements
* Stored procedures
* Entity Frameworks/Hibernate
* Avoiding cross site request forgeries

### Modern security frameworks
* Introduction to modern frameworks
* Vault
* Modern security design patterns
  * Dynamic secrets
  * Automatic credential rotation
  * Cubbyhole response wrapping
  * Encryption as a service
* Where to go from here

### Session security
* Perfect Secrecy
* Asymmetric and symmetric encryption
* Session IDs
* Policies
* Hijacking/Fixation Attacks

### Framework architecture
* Threading
* Privileges
* Audits/Logs
* Secure coding
* Encryption services
* Static code analysis
* Securing the API (both publishing and consuming API)
* JWT
* Static code analysis (e.g. with Sonarqube)

### Labs
  * Labs will be provided for each section
  * Labs will be based on C/C++ and Embedded C/C++ Groups
