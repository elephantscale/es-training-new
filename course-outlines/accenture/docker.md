## Overview

Containerization has taken the IT world by storm, in the last few years. Large software houses, starting from Google and Amazon, are running significant portions of their production load in containers.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

This course introduces the students to containers in general, then continues with Kubernetes, its architecture, its use in production, and its best practices.

## What you will learn

* Docker
    * Benefits of containerization
    * Docker concepts and architecture
    * Using docker commands

    * Deploying docker containers
    * Working with container registries
* Kubernetes
    * Kubernetes concepts and architecture
    * Orchestrating Docker containers with Kubernetes
    * Labels and selectors
    * Deploying resilient, scalable services
    * Kubernetes volumes
    * Kubernetes networking


## Audience

Developers, Architects, DevOps

## Duration

5 half days

## Format

Lectures and hands-on labs. (50%, 50%)

## Prerequisites

* Must-have: comfortable with Linux environment.
* Previous development experience in popular languages (Java, Python, Javascript) is recommended.
* Some exposure to docker is assumed.

## Lab environment

A cloud based lab environment will be provided.

## Students will need the following
