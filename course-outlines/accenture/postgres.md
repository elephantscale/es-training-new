# PostgresSQL Server

## Overview

PostgresSQL is an very popular open-source RBMS server that has found grown in popularity.
As an open source tool, Postgres is accessible to all but there is still a need for 
developers and admins to be trained on the specifics of the Postgres plaform

This course is an admin level course for learning how to run and administer PostgresSQl.
