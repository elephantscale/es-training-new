* Today, hackers have achieved tremendous successes while the software developers are just beginning to learn about secure coding. This course is for developers who want to defend against hackers.
* SolarWinds was the largest hack of the century: a thousand Russian hackers would work daily work on it for almost a year, spying on
tens of thousands of the US enterprises and government agencies, through the software distributed by SolarWinds.
* This course is build to help your company avoid a similar disaster. Presented as a series of red team - blue team exercises,
it leads developers to interchangeably play the attack and defense roles, exposing to both sides of the cybersecurity domain 
and raising the overall level of defense for your company.
* The course is intended for software architects and engineers. It gives them a practical level of experience, achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% demo work with student's participation. 

##  Course objectives
* Understand what security is
* Add basic, programmatic security to your code
* Understand how to defend against an attack
* Understand how to secure resources

## Duration
* 3 days
## Audience
* Software Architects, Developers, Managers
## Prerequisites
* Familiarity with any programming language 
* However, Java is preferred, since many labs are in Java
* Be able to navigate the Linux command line
* Basic knowledge of command-line Linux editors (VI / nano)

## Lab environment:
* A working environment will be provided for students.  Students would only need an SSH client and a browser.
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines.
* A complete checklist is provided
