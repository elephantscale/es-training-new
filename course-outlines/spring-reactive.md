## Overview

* Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for low-latency, high-throughput workloads. Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.

* The course is intended for software developers and architects. It gives the participants a practical level of experience, achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% demo work with student’s participation. 

## Benefits

* After taking the course, participants will be able to

    - Define use cases for reactive systems
    - Plan the implementations with Spring Reactive
    - Implement scalable reactive systems
    - Test scalable reactive systems.

## Duration:
