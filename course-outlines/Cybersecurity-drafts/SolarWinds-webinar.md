## SolarWinds' podcast

* Companies now are up against state actors
* Here is how we will protect against the same type of hack - hash signatures of build artifact    
* Learn to
    * Audit your cloud trust relationship
    * Document network
    * Enhance permission rules
    
* Intern did it!

## Let's go deeper into the hack

* Why SolarWinds was a good target
    * hundreds of thousands of customers
    * 18,000 who were vulnerable to Russia's attack
    * They rely on it for network monitoring and other services

## Bypass anti-intrusion systems

* US has invested billions of dollars in Einstein, a system designed to detect digital intrusions
* SolarWinds hack was what's known as a "supply chain" attack
* supply chain threat should be treated more seriously
* See recent Azure business partner hack

## Apple's approach

* **walled garden**
* All apps go through a strict Apple approval process
* But when the most advanced hackers do succeed in breaking in
    * Apple's extraordinary defenses end up protecting the attackers themselves

## The problem

* Hackers need to find only one whole
* Developers need to protect all of them
* Hackers get huge payout
* Developers get nothing if they are secure
    * But are blamed when they are hacked

## Our approach

* DO 
    * Start game
    * Red vs Blue
    * Reward developers
        * Log attacks, reward defenses
        * Keep stats, leaderboard
* FOR EACH (Known-hack)

## Of course, best practices

* Known vuln scan
* Containerize...
* Hash signatures of build artifacts
* CI/CD for Sec
