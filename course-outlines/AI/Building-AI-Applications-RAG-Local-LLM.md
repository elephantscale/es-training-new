# Building AI Applications RAG with Local LLM

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

June 10, 2025

## Course Description

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before. 
* However, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI
* In this course, the students learn how build the AI systems. 
  * Prepare your data and store it in the semantic search databases
  * Rules of sending questions to AI
  * Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
  * Best practices for cloud architecture 

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an AI in a correct way.
* Script talking to AI for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Structure the flow of conversation with AI about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Three days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning
* Exposure to coding in any language
* Familiarity with Python helpful


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
