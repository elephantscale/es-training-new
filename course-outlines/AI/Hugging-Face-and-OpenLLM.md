# Hugging Face and OpenLLMs

(C)Copyright Elephant Scale

October 30, 2024

## Course Description

* Hugging Face is a hosted collection of open models that a helps use Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLM).
* The distinctive features of open models are secure handling of proprietary data, not sending the data to third parties, while providing competitive quality.
* Knowledge of modern AI implementation architectures and responsible use of AI is required of engineers and is provided by this course. 
  
## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know...
* How to understand the current state of the art in Deep Learning and AI
* How to utilize the existing results through transfer learning, pre-training, and fine-tuning.
* How to package your models for deployment.
* How to create machine learning pipelines and improve them in production.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate

## Duration
* Two days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with computer science.


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
