(C) Copyright Elephant Scale
May 4, 2025

### Course Description
* Course goals
  * This course helps Cisco fulfill its strategy of enabling its clients to deliver secure AI systems
  * This is evidenced by Cisco's acquisition of [Robust Intelligence](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/evaluating-security-risk-in-deepseek-and-other-frontier-reasoning-models), a leading security firm.
  
* The "Cybersecurity for AI Professionals" workshop aims to equip AI professionals with a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity threats specific to AI systems. 
* Participants will learn best practices for securing AI models, data, and pipelines, integrating these skills into the AI development lifecycle. 
* By providing hands-on experience with real-world vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques, the program prepares professionals to implement robust cybersecurity frameworks, incident response protocols, and defence strategies against adversarial attacks. 
* Additionally, the workshop emphasizes the importance of ethical and compliance considerations, ensuring participants are well-prepared to address privacy, transparency, and regulatory standards within AI cybersecurity.

### Learning Outcomes	
* Upon completing this course, participants will:
* Understand and identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities in AI systems.
* Implement data protection and secure pipeline practices for AI development.
* Integrate cybersecurity frameworks and incident response protocols into AI workflows.
* Analyze and defend against adversarial attacks on AI systems.
* Address ethical considerations and compliance standards for cybersecurity in AI.

## Audience
* AI engineers and developers
