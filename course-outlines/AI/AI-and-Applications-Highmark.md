  Contract Generation – we have an area under our org that handles the contracts, benefit booklets, etc. for Sales and their clients, so use cases that may assist with contract/benefit booklet generation or review, etc.  We are already pursuing the ability for AI to do translations into other languages.
  Inventory Management - we have areas that support sales with their pre-sale quoting activities, as well as post-sale client set-up, so use cases that may assist in managing that work or automating certain aspects of their work.
  Customer Behavior – any use cases that may predict a customer’s behavior in terms of products/services we should be recommending.
  Sales training – any uses that may assist in the development of training or training materials/user guides for sales.
  Analytics – we have an area that supports some analytics tools for sales providing various client specific reporting, so use cases that may help identify ways to make the code more efficient or check the quality would be helpful (one of the tools used is Encompass and they are also looking into ways to convert SAS to R or Python).
