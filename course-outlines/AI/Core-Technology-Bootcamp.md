# Core Technology Bootcamp
(C) Elephant Scale  
* April 4, 2025

### Audience Profile
* Participants: Second-year generalist consultants with a business background and beginner-level knowledge on ‘core technology’ topics (e.g., cloud, SW engineering excellence and principles, tech strategy, architecture, enterprise platforms, cyber security etc.)
* Objectives: 
    * Enable consultants to understand and communicate core technology concepts effectively (but not perform technical tasks themselves).
    * Prepare participants to engage in meaningful discussions with technology experts and business stakeholders. Would merge this with objectives


### Program Rationale (Day-wise)
* Day 1: Understanding Cloud Computing & Migration

  * a) APIs and DevSecOps are essential for software-driven businesses, ensuring rapid and secure deployment. 
  * b) We cover API architecture, microservices, CI/CD, and security practices that drive digital agility. Consultants will learn how modern applications are built, secured, and deployed.
* Day 3: IT Architecture, Containers & Business Modernization
  * a) Enterprises struggle with legacy IT infrastructure, and containerization (Kubernetes) is key to modernization. 
  * b) This session explains monolithic vs microservices, enterprise architecture, and technical debt. Consultants will be able to advise on IT modernization strategies and cost-benefit trade-offs.
* Day 4: Data Governance & Cybersecurity Resilience
  * a) Businesses depend on data-driven decisions and cybersecurity threats impact resilience. 
  * b) Consultants will learn how organizations safeguard data and mitigate security risks. In these sessions we covers data management frameworks, privacy regulations, cybersecurity risks, and compliance.
* Day 5: Future Tech & Capstone Project
  * a) Consultants must understand the role of emerging technologies in shaping the next wave of enterprise IT. 
  * b) In this session we additionally cover cloud security, automation, digital transformation risks, and culminates in a capstone project. Participants will synthesize insights, apply knowledge to real-world scenarios, and present strategic recommendations.
