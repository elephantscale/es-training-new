* Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands as the premier cloud platform, providing a powerful environment for developers to build top-tier, scalable applications. When utilized correctly, cloud-based
applications can typically deliver around 50% cost savings compared to self-hosting solutions.

* AWS Machine Learning (ML) and AI (formerly SageMaker, and now Bedrock is the leading AI application platform for building industrial AI application.

* To fully leverage these benefits, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of AWS services and best practices. This course is designed for software developers, architect, project leaders, machine learning and AI specialists  
and professionals, focusing on architecting and maintaining AWS-based Machine Learning and AI solutions. It includes a balanced mix of 50% lectures and 50% hands-on implementation labs within the AWS environment.

## The goal of the course and advanced praise

* Elephant Scale's AWS Machine Learning and AI Cert helps participants achieve the level of knowledge needed for the certification.
