March 3, 2025

## Overview

* Machine Learning (ML) is changing the world. To use ML effectively, one needs to understand the algorithms and how to utilize them. This course provides an introduction into the most popular machine learning algorithms.

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before. However, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI

## What you will learn:
* Python 
* ML Concepts
* Regressions (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
* Classification, clustering
* Prepare your data and store it in the semantic search databases
* Rules of sending questions to AI
* Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
* Best practices for cloud architecture

## Audience:
Data analysts,  Software Engineers, Data scientists

## Duration:
Three days

## Skill Level:
Beginner to Intermediate

## Industry Use Cases Covered
We will study and solve some of most common industry use cases; listed below


## Prerequisites
* Programming background
* Familiarity with Python would be a plus, but not required
* No machine learning or AI knowledge is assumed


## Lab environment
Cloud based lab environment will be provided to students, no need to install anything on the laptop

### Students will need the following
