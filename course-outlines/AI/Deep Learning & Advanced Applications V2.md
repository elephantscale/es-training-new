# Deep Learning & Advanced Applications V2

(C)Copyright Elephant Scale

November 11, 2024

## Course Description

* Today, Deep Learning can accomplish results that are nothing short of miraculous. 
In this course, we assume that you do not want to re-invent wheels. Rather, you want to know what is
available as low-hanging fruit. In other words, you are looking for magic but you don't want to compete with
teams who create this magic. You want to partner with them and achieve the same quality results but
with a practical reasonable expense of time and resources.

  
## Course objectives
* By the end of this course, students will know...
* How to understand the current state of the art in Deep Learning and AI
* How to put the claims of AI to the test
* How to utilize the existing results through transfer learning, pre-training, and fine-tuning.
* How to package your models for deployment.
* How to create machine learning pipelines and improve them in production.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate

## Duration
* Two days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
