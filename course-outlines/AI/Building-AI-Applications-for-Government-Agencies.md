# Building AI Applications for Government Agencies

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

February 5, 2025

## Course Description

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before. 
* However, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI
* In this course, the students learn how build the AI systems. 
  * Prepare your data and store it in the semantic search databases (RAG)
  * Rules of sending questions to AI (Prompt Engineering)
  * Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
  * Best practices for cloud architecture 

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an AI in a correct way.
* Script talking to AI for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Structure the flow of conversation with AI about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Three to five days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning
* Exposure to coding in any language
* Familiarity with Python helpful


## Format

### Architecture, testing, and continuous improvements
* Overview of Amazon, Azure, and Google clouds of RAG
* Evaluating and debugging Generative AI
* Practical examples and demos

## Practical Use Cases
### Intelligent Document Processing for Policy & Compliance
* Overview:
  * Government agencies deal with vast amounts of unstructured textâ€”from policy documents to legislative texts. AI can be used to:
    * Automatically extract key information.
    * Summarize long documents.
    * Verify compliance with regulations.
* Lab 
  * Develop a pipeline that uses NLP to extract and categorize key clauses from legislative documents, helping agencies quickly assess compliance and policy implications.

### Citizen Services Chatbots & Virtual Assistants

* Overview:
  * Enhance public service delivery by developing AI-driven chatbots that provide:
    * 24/7 citizen support.
    * Multilingual support.
    * Personalized guidance on government services.
* Lab
  * Build a prototype chatbot that integrates with a government service database, enabling citizens to inquire about service eligibility, status updates, or application processes.

### Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
* Overview:
  * Government agencies can leverage AI to forecast demand and optimize resource allocation across various services:
    * Budget planning.
    * Emergency response management.
    * Infrastructure maintenance.
* Lab
  * Create a predictive model using historical data to forecast the need for emergency services in a region, integrating geospatial data and demographic trends.

### Fraud Detection and Audit Automation

* Overview:
  * Detecting and preventing fraud is a major concern in government operations. AI can:
    * Identify anomalies in financial transactions.
    * Flag suspicious procurement activities.
    * Streamline internal audits.
* Lab
  * Develop an anomaly detection system on a sample dataset of transactions, showing how AI can flag potential fraud for human review.


### Social Media Monitoring & Public Sentiment Analysis
* Overview:
  * Governments can benefit from understanding public sentiment around policies or services:
    * Track reactions to new initiatives.
    * Monitor misinformation.
    * Gauge public opinion in near-real time.
* Lab
* Use NLP to analyze tweets or public comments about a policy change, then visualize sentiment trends over time.


### Ethical AI and Accountability in Public Sector Applications
* Overview:
  * With increasing AI use in government, ethical considerations become paramount:
    * Ensure transparency and fairness.
    * Mitigate bias.
    * Establish accountability frameworks.
* Lab
  * Engage students in a workshop to audit an AI system for fairness and transparency, followed by discussions on policy implications and governance mechanisms.
