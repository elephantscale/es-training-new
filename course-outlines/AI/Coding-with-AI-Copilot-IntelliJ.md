July 18, 2025

## Course Description

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before.
  * As Andrew Ng says, AI will not replace programmers; rather, programmers that use AI will replace those programmers that do not use AI.
  * In this course, the students learn how to build systems using AI.
  * Rules of sending questions to AI

* In addition, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI
  * Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
  * Best practices for cloud architecture

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an AI in a correct way.
* Script talking to AI for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Structure the flow of conversation with AI about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Two days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning
* Exposure to coding in any language
* Familiarity with Python helpful


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
  * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser

## Detailed outline

### Prompt Engineering
* Introduction to AI
* Iterative development
  * How to iteratively analyze and refine your prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.
* Chatbot
  * How to use an AI to have extended conversations with chatbots personalized or specialized for specific tasks or behaviors.


### Architecture, testing, and continuous improvements
* Overview of Amazon, Azure, and Google clouds for RAG implementation
* Evaluating and debugging Generative AI
* Practical examples and demos

### Labs (some are optional)

* GitHub Copilot for code development
* Claude 3.5 Sonnet for better coding
* ChatGPT complete plan of architecture, approach, implementation, and test creation
* How to use Llama use for extra privacy

### GitHub Copilot/JetBrains AI
* Introduction to Copilot and IntelliJ
* Setup/Configure Copilot in IntelliJ
* Creating a new project
* Hello World using Copilot
* Java datatypes in Copilot
* Java exception handling with Copilot
* Multithreading with Copilot
* Functional programming and lambda with Copilot

### Advanced Copilot (optional)

* Working interactively with Copilot
  * Copilot Chat in IntelliJ-based IDEs – asking questions, explaining diffs, and running “code brushes” like Explain or Refactor. 
GitHub Docs

* Prompt & context techniques – adding files/lines to the chat, custom instructions, and prompt-library shortcuts.

* Autonomous assistance
  * Agent Mode (GA July 2025) – letting Copilot carry out multi-file tasks, suggest terminal commands, and self-heal build errors. 
The GitHub Blog

* Edit Mode vs. Agent Mode – when you want granular, file-scoped edits versus end-to-end task execution. 
GitHub Docs

* Quality & test generation
* Unit-, integration-, and property-based test scaffolding directly from chat or code selection. 
GitHub Docs

* AI-driven debugging – stack-trace explanations, log-analysis prompts, and quick-fix suggestions.
  * Refactoring & documentation
  * Copilot Edits and Code Review – AI-suggested refactors, readability improvements, and PR summaries. 
GitHub Docs

* Automatic Javadoc / README / commit-message generation with JetBrains AI Assistant.

* Secure & responsible usage
  * Security-oriented prompts – dependency-update suggestions, secret-scanning, and license-compliance checks. 
GitHub Docs

* Enterprise policy & content-exclusion settings for proprietary codebases.

* Git & CI/CD hooks – generating PR descriptions, GitHub Actions steps, and chat-triggered pipelines.

* Performance & adoption metrics
Measuring suggestion-accept-rate, editing time saved, and guidelines for tuning privacy/telemetry settings.
