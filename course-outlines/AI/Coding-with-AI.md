October 8, 2024

## Course Description

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before.
  * As Andrew Ng says, AI will not replace programmers; rather, programmers that use AI will replace those programmers that do not use AI.
  * In this course, the students learn how build systems using AI.
  * Rules of sending questions to AI

* In addition, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI
  * Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
  * Best practices for cloud architecture

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an AI in a correct way.
* Script talking to AI for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Structure the flow of conversation with AI about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Three to five days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning
* Exposure to coding in any language
* Familiarity with Python helpful


## Format
* Lectures and hands on labs. (50% - 50%)


## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
  * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser

## Detailed outline

### Prompt Engineering
* Introduction to AI
* Iterative development
  * How to iteratively analyze and refine your prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.
* Chatbot
  * How to use an AI to have extended conversations with chatbots personalized or specialized for specific tasks or behaviors.


### Semantic Search

* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Semantic search
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Recommender systems
* Hybrid search
* Facial similarity search
* Anomaly detection

### LangChain, glue to put it together
* Models, prompts, and parsers
* Memory
* Chains
* Q&A
* Evaluation
* Conversational bot


### Architecture, testing, and continuous improvements
* Overview of Amazon, Azure, and Google clouds of RAG
* Evaluating and debugging Generative AI
* Practical examples and demos

### Practical use case
* How to make sure your data stays private and under your control
* Preparing reports for executives
* Employee turnover and how to capture their experience and know-how
* Automating daily tasks: pull stats, post them to Slack
* Integrating Kanban into your workflow with AI
