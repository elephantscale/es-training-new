October 9, 2024

## Course Description

* AI opens ways to building smart applications as never before.
  * As Andrew Ng says, AI will not replace programmers; rather, programmers that use AI will replace those programmers that do not use AI.
  * In this course, the students learn how build systems using AI.
  * Rules of sending questions to AI

* In addition, many use cases require implementing AI in a secure, responsible manner, including but not limited to:
  * Not sending your data to third-party online AI services
  * Keeping control over the data used for training
  * Controlling actions taken by AI
  * Secure AI implementations using local models or networked local copy of the model
  * Best practices for cloud architecture

## After the course, you will be able to do the following tasks

* Talk to an AI in a correct way.
* Script talking to AI for a programmatic implementation.
* Organize your private documents for the implementation and break them into meaningful fragments for storing in the semantic search engine
* Structure the flow of conversation with AI about your private documents.
* Implement the system in production.
* Architect testing, and continuous improvements.

## Audience
* Developers, data scientists, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level

* Intermediate to advanced.

## Duration
* Three to five days

## Prerequisites
* General familiarity with machine learning
* Exposure to coding in any language
* Familiarity with Python helpful
