April 20, 2022

## Overview

The use of Data Analytics is changing the world. To use it effectively, one needs to understand the algorithms and how to utilize them. 

This course teaches doing Data Analytics using Databricks and PySpark.

## Training objectives:
* Python primer
* Databricks and PySpark
* Data analytics algorithms

## You will learn to
* Use Python and Jupyter to read and summarize your data
* Apply DataFrames to represent structured data for analysis
* Visualize the data and form initial hypotheses
* Apply statistics to data analysis
* Deal with large volumes of data on the Databricks Spark using PySpark
* Formulate data predictions

## Audience:
* Data analysts, software engineers, data scientists

## Duration:
* Three Days divided into half day sessions

## Skill Level:
Beginner to Intermediate

## Prerequisites
* Programming or data analytics background
* Familiarity with Python would be a plus, but not required

## Lab environment
* All labs will be done in the cloud, in the Databricks environment
* Students will use PySpark Freemium Accounts (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/databricks/)
* No local install will be required

## Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet.  Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly
