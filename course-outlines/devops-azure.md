# DevOps on Microsoft Azure

Â© Elephant Scale

February 12, 2025

Microsoft Azure stands as the premier cloud platform, providing a powerful environment for developers to build top-tier, scalable applications. When utilized correctly, cloud-based
applications can typically deliver around 50% cost savings compared to self-hosting solutions.

To fully leverage these benefits, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of Azure services and best practices. This course is designed for software developers, administrators, and DevOps
professionals, focusing on architecting and maintaining Azure-based solutions. It includes a balanced mix of 50% lectures and 50% hands-on implementation labs within the Azure environment.

## Duration: 3 days

## Audience: Software developers

## Prerequisites:

* familiarity with programming in at least one language
* be able to navigate Linux command line
* basic knowledge of command line Linux editors (VI / nano)

## Lab environment:

Lab Azure environment will be provided for students.
Alternatively, we can work in the client's Azure account.

**Zero Install:** There is no need to install software on students' machines.
