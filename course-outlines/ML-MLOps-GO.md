# Machine Learning and MLOps with Go

(C) Copyright Elephant Scale

October 24, 2021


## Overview

* This course teaches how to create Machine Learning (ML) models with Go, and how to deploy these models using ML pipelines. 
* ML is usually done by data scientists while ML pipelines by data engineers, also called MLOps. For successful projects, the two must come together.

## Audience
Developers, team leads, project managers

## Skill Level
Introductory - Intermediate

## Duration
Two days

## Format
* Lectures and hands-on labs (50% - 50%)

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Go language

## Lab environment
* Zero Install: There is no need to install software on students' machines!
* A lab environment in the cloud will be provided for students.

### Students will need the following
* A reasonably modern laptop with unrestricted connection to the Internet. Laptops with overly restrictive VPNs or firewalls may not work properly.
    * A checklist to verify connectivity will be provided
* Chrome browser
