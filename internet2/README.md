## Labs Verification

Feb 23, 2023

- Verified IAM labs on Azure, Google and AWS


## Jason Smith's labs

Hi Sujee,
Our labs are configured as follows for Terraform. 
Each student logs into the AWS console and uses CloudShell
The labs are found at this here: https://jruels.github.io/tf-reusable-code/

For Ansible I spin up some VMs using Terraform and configure them using Ansible. Students log in using SSH keys. I've attached the code I use for Terraform and Ansible.

The Ansible labs are available here: https://jruels.github.io/ansible-best-practices/

Please find the slides here:
