## About This Class

* A **get-your-hands-dirty approach**

* Goals
    - **Look a Python code to load the system**
    - **Add testing** 
    - **Add profiling**
    - And **implement** improvements

* Beyond the scope
    - Basic Python programming is assumed    

Notes:

---

## Prerequisites & Expectations

* Development background
    - Need to be comfortable programming - there are many labs
    - Our labs are in Python (If you don't know these, don't worry, we will walk you through it)

* Basic knowledge of Linux

Notes:

---

## Our Teaching Philosophy

* Enable you to be a **'Python practitioner'** by giving you
    - The essential knowledge of Python performance
    - Plenty of time and playground environment for learning about performance
    - Show how to evaluate, test, and tweak Python code
    - Expose you to useful tools

* Emphasis on concepts & fundamentals, not API

* Highly interactive (questions, discussions, etc.  are welcome)

* Hands-on - lots and lots of labs! (learn by doing)


Notes:

* All the labs on Linux and Mac for Python 3
