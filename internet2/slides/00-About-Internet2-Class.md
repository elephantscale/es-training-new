## About quizzes

* We have many quizzes interspersed in the slides. They are fun and many people enjoy them.
* However, we do not expect you to always know the answer - leave that for those who are taking certification tests.
* The quizzes are for knowledge check, yes, but also for pointing out additional information.
    * This means that using Google to find answers is expected
