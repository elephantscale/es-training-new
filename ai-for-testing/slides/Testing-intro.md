# Software testing conundrum

---


## Software testing is expensive

* up-front and recurring investment 
  * in labor and assets
* The cost of fixing defects increases exponentially
* Bugs found early during requirements elicitation
  * cheaper to fix
* Bugs discovered while coding 
  * More expensive
* Bug found after the software is released
  * Even more expensive
* Found in production
  * cost you your reputation and business.

## Who will gain from the right approach?

* The managers and project overall, as above
* Developers who get better feedback
* __Testers__ - our hearts are with them

---

## The middle way

* The key to controlling quality cost-effectively 
  * find the right level of testing effort 
  * based on the risks associated with the release
* We want to do just enough testing 
  * remove the most harmful defects prior to the release. 
* The more test coverage, the better, but
  * coverage comes with too great an investment cost,
  * you end up overtesting 
  * and not getting ROI

---

## Need for automation

* One way to reduce testing costs and improve your ROI is through automation
* By removing manual steps
  * organizations can scale operations faster, easier, and more cost-effectively.
* Unfortunately, the current state of the art in test automation still requires significant manual effort
* Humans have to first 
  * understand the software requirements, 
  * design and specify test cases, 
  * and then manually translate them into machine-readable scripts.

---

## Benefits of automation

* A software-testing tool or framework is needed
* It will execute the scripts against the system under test and logs the results. 
* However, the moment the script ends ... 
  * humans enter back into the loop 
    * to verify the results
    * and translate them into actionable items.

## Automation with Artificial Intelligence (AI) 

* __The good news__
  * advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
  * are being used to bridge
    * the gap between
      * manual and 
      * automated software testing.

## Who Is This Workshop For?

* Technology leader
  * CTO, 
  * VP of engineering, 
  * quality director, or 
  * engineering manager 
  * responsible for developing high-quality software, 
  * interested in learning how to scale those efforts 
  * cost-effectively through test automation,
* Roles
  * automation engineers, 
  * software engineers, 
  * architects, 
  * technical leads, or 
  * researchers 
  * using or developing automated software-testing solutions.

---

## What we will cover

* the grand challenges and limitations of traditional automated testing tools
* how AI-driven approaches are helping to overcome these problems. 
* Explore the application of AI/ML to 
  * functional 
  * structural 
  * performance 
  * user-design testing
* dive into techniques for automating graphically intensive solutions
* such as video streaming and gaming applications.

---

## Goals

* Wide knowledge of the various applications of AI-driven testing, 
* an understanding of its current benefits and limitations, and 
* insights into the future of this emerging discipline.
