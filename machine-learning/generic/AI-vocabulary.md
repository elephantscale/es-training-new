 * **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**
   - Focused on a specific tasks
   - Self driving, smart speaker, image recognition
   - Tremendous progress in the last few years

&nbsp;

 * **Artificial Generic Intelligence (AGI)**
    - AI can do anything a human can do
    - We are decades or hundreds of years away from this
    - So no need to worry about killer robots yet :-)

 * **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broader concept of "making machines smart"

 * **Machine Learning:** Current application of AI that machines learn from data using mathematical, statistical models

 * **Deep Learning: (Hot!)** Using Neural Networks to solve some hard problems

## Data Science

 * **Data Science:** Deriving intelligence from data

 * For example, a real estate company can use data science to figure out which types of homes to build to maximize profits

## Data Science

 * A machine learning algorithm can learn from the past data and predict house prices for new houses coming on market

&nbsp;

| Bedrooms (input 0) | Bathrooms (input 1) | Size (input 2) | Sale Price (in thousands) (we are trying to predict) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 2                  | 0                   | 1499           | 229                                                  |
| 2                  | 1                   | 1799           | 319                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2399           | 599                                                  |
| 3                  | 1                   | 1999           | 499                                                  |
| 3                  | 2.4                 | 2199           | 549                                                  |

## Data Science vs. Machine Learning

 * **Data Science** works with existing data and derive intelligence

 * **Machine Learning** learns from existing data and predicts on new/unseen data

 * The definitions are not clear-cut,  some people use these interchangeably

---

## Neural Networks

 * Layers of parallel processing elements, working together to solve very complex tasks

 * Inspired by neurons from human brain

 * Used in Deep Learning

 * (More on this later)

## Training vs. Inference

*  **Training**
    - Feeding data to an algorithm to create a model
    - Computationally expensive (can take hours, days, weeks)
        - Google translate model trains on 2 billion+ words on 99+ GPUs for week+
*  **Prediction / Inference**
    - Created model answering questions (very fast)
    - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - "What are the recommended movies for this user"

## Data Size Vs. Model Size

- An algorithm can train on small / large / huge amount of data (depending on problem complexity)
    - Since it can be computationally very intensive;  So we may use cluster of computers for training
    - Clusters can contain 99s (or 999s) of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs

- The resulting model is orders of magnitude smaller in size
    - it could fit in your phone!

## Algorithm vs. Model

* **Algorithm**
    - Algorithms are 'generic' mathematical formulas
* **Model**
    - algorithm + data ==> model
* Often Algorithm and Model are used interchangeably
