## Algorithm vs. Model

  * Often Algorithm and Model are used interchangeably
  * Algorithm: Mathematical / statistical formula or methodology
  * Training the algorithm with data yields a model
    - Algorithm + training data -> model
    - Model = Algorithm(data)

## Model

  * **'Model'**:  
    Mathematical object describing the relationship between input and output

  * We can treat ML model as a 'black box'

  * Input goes in, model produces an output
