## About This Class

* A **practical approach to ML**

* Goals
    - **'Top-Down' learning**
    - **Learn** fundamentals of ML
    - And **implement** them in an ML environment

* Beyond the scope
    - Deep Math / Stats coverage
    - Advanced concepts

Notes:

---

## Prerequisites & Expectations

* Development background
    - Need to be comfortable programming - there are many labs
    - Our labs are in Python & Spark  (If you don't know these, don't worry, we will walk you through it)

* Basic knowledge of Linux

* We don't expect Math / Statistics background

Notes:

---

## What if I Don't Know Enough Math / Stats?

* Most often people are told to start Machine Learning with Linear Algebra / Calculus
    - These are hard subjects and lot of people loose interest pretty quickly
    - Or people spend too much time in Math / Stats

* Our approach:
    - We acknowledge Math / Stats are essential inner workings of Machine Learning
    - A practitioner can go far in ML with a little fundamentals and without too deep knowledge in Math / Stats

*  **Learn by practicing**
    - We do recommend you review the theories behind ML at your leisure

## Our Teaching Philosophy

* Enable you to be a **'data practitioner'** by giving you
    - The essential knowledge of ML
    - Plenty of time and playground environment for learning the API
    - Show how to evaluate, test, and tweak the models
    - Expose you to useful tools

* Emphasis on concepts & fundamentals, not API

* Highly interactive (questions, discussions ..etc  are welcome)

* Hands-on - lots and lots of labs! (learn by doing)


Notes:

* All the labs are verified at 1.3 even though latest is 1.4

---

## Some Highlights of this Class

* Machine Learning is the focus of this course
* The concepts are generic you can implement them any ML platforms (R, Python, Spark)

## About You And Me

* About you
    - Your Name
    - Your background (developer, admin, manager, etc.)
    - Technologies you are familiar with
    - Familiarity with Machine Learning   
    (scale of 1 - 4 ;  1 - new, 2 - know some concepts,  3 - took a course, 4 -  using it at work)
    - Something non-technical about you!  
    (favorite ice cream flavor / hobby...etc)
