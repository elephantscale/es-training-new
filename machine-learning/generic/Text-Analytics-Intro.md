## Text Analytics Has Become Very Prominent

 * Rise of social media (Twitter / Facebook) allows lots of text exchanges

 * Customer 'chat' interaction

 * Customer emails

 * Unstructured data exists in many forms

 * Mostly underutilized

 * Can use data to great effect given right tools




Notes:

## Use Case: Customer Service Via Social Media

## Use Case: Sentiment Analysis

- What are customers saying about a brand / product

## Use Case - Sentiment Analytics

---

## Use Case : Support Tickets

- Automatic ticket routing
    - Parse the ticket / understand the context and send it to the right queue

- Assign priority (High, Medium, Low) based on ticket text

```
Ticket-123

When I try to save the document as PDF, it crashes

# Text Analytics Tools and Algorithms

## Text Analytics Tools and Algorithms


 * Text visualizers: Word Cloud

 * 'Bag of Words'

 * Top-N words

 * Ngrams

 * Vectorizing
    - TF-IDF
    - Word2Vec

Notes:

## Visualizing Text - Word Clouds (State of the Union Speech 2014)

<img src="../../assets/images/machine-learning/3rd-party/text-analytics-word-cloud-1.png"  style="width:60%;float:right;"/><!-- {"left" : 5.45, "top" : 2.16, "height" : 2.9, "width" : 4.72} -->

- Word Clouds are really neat way to get a 'sense' of the text

- Most frequent words are the biggest
    - 'America',  'Cheers'

# Bag of Words

## 'Bag of Words'


 * Split the document(s) into words

## Bag of Words Process


 *  **Cleanup**
     -  **Step 1: Lowercase text:**
        (The Sun was bright -> the sun was bright)

     -  **Step 2: Remove punctuations**
        (!  ,   .  #)

     -  **Step 3: Remove numbers (optional)**
        (1, 2, 3)

     -  **Step 4: Remove STOP words (and any other unnecessary words)**  
        ( the, is, in, and)*

 *  **Tokenize**

     - Break text into words  (bag of words)

 *  **Analyze**

## Bag of Words Example: "Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens


 * We are going to walk through processing some text(slightly modified version)

```text
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times! It was the age of wisdom!!
$123

```

## Text Cleanup: Lowercase, Remove Punctuations


```text
It was the best of times. It was the worst of times! It was the age of wisdom!!
$123

```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 1.49, "height" : 0.59, "width" : 10.25} -->

## Dealing With Stop Words

<img src="../../assets/images/machine-learning/text-analytics-bag-of-words-alice-1.png"  style="width:50%;float:right;"/><!-- {"left" : 5.93, "top" : 1.62, "height" : 2.81, "width" : 4.31} -->

 * Sample stop words
     - English (total 153):  *'a', 'about', 'above', 'after', 'again', 'against',..*
     - Spanish (total 313): *'a', 'al', '*  *algo*  *', '*  *algunas*  *', '*  *algunos*  *',*  *...*
     - German (total 231):  *'*  *wie*  *', 'also', '*  *alle*  *', '*  *anderer*  *', 'des',*

 * However they don't contribute much to analytics
     - Here we see an example of 'Alice in Wonderland' analysis.  And there are lot of stop words

 * Most text mining packages has a built in stop words dictionaries for various languages

## Tokenizing Text


 * Tokenizing is breaking the text into tokens (words / sentences)

 * Most text algorithms work on 'tokens'

 * Can you spot the differences in word-tokenization below?

## Text Analytic: Word Count


 * Finally we have cleaned up text to do a simple analytics - word count


```text
Original text
-------------

It was the best of times. It was the worst of times! It was the age of wisdom!!
$123

```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 2.15, "height" : 1.17, "width" : 10.25} -->



```text
Cleaned text
-------------

best times worst times age wisdom

```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 3.5, "height" : 1.33, "width" : 6.28} -->


```text

Word count
----------

Total number of words = 6

+-------+-----+
|   word|count|
+-------+-----+
|  best |    1|
|  times|    2|
|  worst|    1|
|    age|    1|
| wisdom|    1|
+-------+-----+

```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 4.99, "height" : 3.97, "width" : 4.94} -->

## Bag of Words Review


 *  **Pros**

    * Easy to implement, well understood

 *  **Cons**

    * Context is lost.Both sentences below map to same 'bag of words'.But the meaning is very different.

## N-gram Analysis

<img src="../../assets/images/machine-learning/text-ngrams-1.png" style="width:50%;float:right;" /><!-- {"left" : 5.53, "top" : 1.9, "height" : 2.61, "width" : 4.54} -->

 * N-gram: sequence of  'n' number of words
     - Words have to be sequential
     - Order matters

 * N = 1: unigram (single word)

 * N = 2: bigram
     - "American people"
     - "black cats"

 * N-gram applications:
     - Predict the next word
       "Please call me `back`"

## N-gram(2) Analysis Results for 'Moby Dick'


 * Moby-dick novel from project Gutenberg
     - 22,108 lines
     - 215,136 words
     - 1,257,274 characters

 * Below the 'bigram' analysis
    - Lot's of filler words

```text
('of', 'the'): 1873,
('in', 'the'): 1129,
('to', 'the'): 725,
('from', 'the'): 432,
('and', 'the'): 358,
('of', 'his'): 357,
('of', 'a'): 331,

## N-gram(2) Analysis After Removing Stop Words


 * Here we show the results of top bigrams analysis on both
 * Moby-dick.txt

     - Before cleanup: 215,136  words
     - After 'stop word' cleanup: 115,093  words
