## About This Class

* A **practical approach to ML**

* Goals
    - **'Top-Down' learning**
    - **Learn** fundamentals of ML
    - And **implement** them in an ML environment

* Beyond the scope
    - Deep Math / Stats coverage
    - Advanced concepts

Notes:

## Prerequisites & Expectations

* Development background
    - Need to be comfortable programming - there are many labs
    - Our labs are in Python
    - If you don't know Python, do not worry.  
        - It is very easy language to pick up
        - and we will provide some resources

* We don't expect Math / Statistics background

## What if I Don't Know Enough Math / Stats?

* Most often people are told to start Machine Learning with Linear Algebra / Calculus
    - These are hard subjects and lot of people loose interest pretty quickly
    - Or people spend too much time in Math / Stats

* Our approach:
    - We acknowledge Math / Stats are essential inner workings of Machine Learning
    - A practitioner can go far in ML with a little fundamentals and without too deep knowledge in Math / Stats

*  **Learn by practicing**
    - We do recommend you review the theories behind ML at your leisure
