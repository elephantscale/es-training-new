# Machine Learning With Apache Spark – 3 days
---

## Overview

* Machine Learning (ML) is changing the world. To use ML effectively, one needs to understand the algorithms and how to utilize them. This course provides an introduction into the most popular machine learning concepts. For each machine learning concept, we first discuss the foundations, its applicability and limitations. Then we explain the implementation/use, and specific use cases. This is achieved through a combination of about 50% lecture, 50% lab work to maintain an optimal balance of theory and practice.
For the lab work, we will utilize Apache Spark and Amazon SageMaker (a fully managed machine learning platform offered by Amazon).
- Please note the following:
  - This is an introductory to intermediate course.   Students interested in gaining in depth knowledge about data science and machine learning should inquire about the 6 month training program that is being run in parallel.  
  - In-depth coverage of Math / Stats is behind Machine Learning is beyond the scope of this course.
  - The emphasis of this course is on ML, not SageMaker or Spark.
  - This course is taught using Spark & Python.
