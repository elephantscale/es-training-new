## About This Class

* A **practical approach to ML**

* Goals
    - **'Top-Down' learning**
    - **Learn** fundamentals of ML
    - And **implement** them in an ML environment
    - Then you can drill into details / Math theory behind the algorithm at your leisure

* Beyond the scope
    - Deep Math / Stats coverage
    - Advanced concepts

Notes:

---

## Prerequisites & Expectations

* Development background
    - Need to be comfortable programming - there are many labs
    - Our labs are in Python and Scala. (If you don't know Scala, we will do a Scala Primer at the start)

* Basic knowledge of Linux

* We don't expect Math / Statistics background

Notes:

---

## What if I Don't Know Enough Math / Stats?

* Most often people are told to start Machine Learning with Linear Algebra / Calculus

* These are hard subjects and lot of people loose interest pretty quickly

* Or people spend too much time in Math / Stats

* Our approach:
    - We acknowledge Math / Stats are essential inner workings of Machine Learning
    - A practitioner can go far in ML with a little fundamentals and without too deep knowledge in Math / Stats 
    
    **Learn by practicing**

    - We do recommend you review the theories behind ML at your leisure

## Goal For This ML Class

* Goal for this class is to give you 'data practitioner' level of knowledge

## Our Teaching Philosophy

* Enable you to be a **'data practitioner'** by giving you
    - The essential knowledge of ML
    - Plenty of time and playground environment for learning the API
    - Show how to evaluate, test, and tweak the models
    - Expose you to useful tools

* Emphasis on concepts & fundamentals, not API
    - Trust us, API is the easy part!

* Highly interactive (questions, discussions ..etc  are welcome)

* Hands-on – lots and lots of labs! (learn by doing)


Notes:

* All the labs are verified at 1.3 even though latest is 1.4

## Some Highlights of this Class

* This is v2.0 of our previous DS class.  We re-wrote this class to reflect our learnings from the field
* Goals
    - Go deeper: Provide deeper understanding of ML concepts
    - Elevate people from 'copy paste API' level
    - Common track to be taught in R / Python / Spark (Python / Scala)

## Real World Datasets

* We will work on real world datasets such as
    - Uber Trips data
    - Walmart Shopping data
    - Netflix recommendation
    - Health studies
    - Credit card default data
    - Prosper loan data
    - NYSE Stock data

## Typographic Conventions

* Code in the text uses a fixed-width code font, e.g.:

* catalog: Catalog = new CatalogImpl
    - Code fragments are the same, e.g. catalog.speakTruth
    - We **bold/color** text for emphasis
    - Filenames are in italics, e.g. `Catalog.scala`
    - Notes are indicated with a superscript number<sup>(1)</sup> or a **star** *
    - Longer code examples appear in a separate code box - e.g.

```java
object TestApp {  // Basic Spark App (Scala)
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
		val sc = new SparkContext(
      new SparkConf().setMaster("local").setAppName(”TestApp")
		val totalWords = sc.textFile(“file”)
               .flatMap(l => l.split(" ")).count()
		println (“# lines : “ + totalWords)
	}
}
```
