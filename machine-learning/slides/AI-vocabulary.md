## Generic / Narrow AI

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence  (ANI)

- Focused on a specific tasks
- Self driving, smart speaker, image recognition
- Tremendous progress in the last few years



### Artificial Generic Intelligence (AGI)
<img src="../../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/terminator-1.jpg" alt="bank-of-america.png" style="width:20%;float:right;"/>

- AI can do anything a human can do
- We are decades or hundreds of years away from this
- So no need to worry about killer robots yet :-)

## AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning

<img src="../../assets/images/machine-learning/AI-ML-DL-2.png" alt="AI-ML-DL.png" style="width:39%;float:right;"/>

 *  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broader concept of "making machines smart"

 *  **Machine Learning:** Current application of AI that machines learn from data using mathematical, statistical models

 *  **Deep Learning: (Hot!)** Using Neural Networks to solve some hard problems

## Data Science

<img src="../../assets/images/deep-learning/Data-Science.png" alt="Data-Science.png" style="width:29%;float:right;"/>

- **Data Science** : Deriving intelligence from data

- For example, a real estate company can use data science to figure out which types of homes to build to maximize profits

- A machine learning algorithm can learn from the past data and predict house prices for new houses coming on market

| Bedrooms (input 0) | Bathrooms (input 1) | Size (input 2) | Sale Price (in thousands) (we are trying to predict) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 2                  | 0                   | 1499           | 229                                                  |
| 2                  | 1                   | 1799           | 319                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2399           | 599                                                  |
| 3                  | 1                   | 1999           | 499                                                  |
| 3                  | 2.4                 | 2199           | 549                                                  |

## Data Science vs. Machine Learning

- **Data Science** works with existing data and derive intelligence

- **Machine Learning** learns from existing data and predicts on new/unseen data

- The definitions are not clear-cut,  some people use these interchangeably

---

## Neural Networks

 - Layers of parallel processing elements, working together to solve very complex tasks

 - Inspired by neurons from human brain

 - Used in Deep Learning

 - (More on this later)

## Training vs. Inference

*  **Training**
    - Feeding data to an algorithm to create a model
    - Computationally expensive (can take hours, days, weeks)
        - Google translate model trains on 2 billion+ words on 99+ GPUs for week+
*  **Prediction / Inference**
    - Created model answering questions (very fast)
    - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - "What are the recommended movies for this user"

## Data Size Vs. Model Size

- An algorithm can train on small / large / huge amount of data (depending on problem complexity)
    - Since it can be computationally very intensive;  So we may use cluster of computers for training
    - Clusters can contain 99s (or 999s) of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs

- The resulting model is orders of magnitude smaller in size
    - it could fit in your phone!

## Algorithm vs. Model

* **Algorithm**
    - Algorithms are 'generic' mathematical formulas
* **Model**
    - algorithm + data ==> model
* Often Algorithm and Model are used interchangeably
