 *  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broader concept of "making machines smart"

 *  **Machine Learning:** Current application of AI that machines learn from data using mathematical, statistical models

 *  **Deep Learning: (Hot!)** Using Neural Networks to solve some hard problems

## Deep Learning (DL)


* Deep Learning uses Neural networks techniques

* Neural Networks fell out of favor in the 89s as statistics-based methods yielded better results

* Now making a comeback due to Big Data & Big Compute ((cluster computing , GPU and TPU)

* Examples
   - Facebook Deep Face
   - Google Translate
   - Google DeepMind playing GO game
   - IBM Deep Blue winning Jeopardy

## Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning (1/3)

| Features                             | Machine Learning                                              | Deep Learning                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **==> Data size (see next slide for graph)** | Performs reasonably well on small / medium data               | Need large amount of data for reasonable performance             |
| Data Type (see next slides)          | Works well with structured data                               | Can handle structured data & unstructured data                   |

## Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

| Structured Data                                          | Unstructured Data                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data has well defined structure.                         | Structure is not well defined or non existing |
| Data in a database tables are well defined.  10 columns, first column is integer, second column is timestamp ..etc | videos, images                                             |

## Structured Data Examples

- Pretty much any data stored in a schema database

| Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Size | Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

- Text data (CSV, JSON) can have structure too

JSON data

```json
{   "name" : "Joe",
    "email" : "joe@gmail.com" }
```

CSV data (Comma Seperated Values)
```
joe,joe@gmail.com
jane,jane@gmail.com
```

## Unstructured Data Examples


- Text
    - Documents : email, word documents
    - Survey results (customer feedback)
    - customer support ticket notes

- Binary data
    - Audio (phone call recordings)
    - Images
    - Video (YouTube videos)

## Semi-Structured Data

- This is 'between' structured and and unstructured

- Data has some structure, but it may not be well defined

- Example, tweet data

```json
{   "user_id" : "user123",
    "timestamp" : "2018-09-20 12:00:05 EST",
    "device" : "iPhone X",
    "location" : "34.893, 120.979",
    "tweet" : "Enjoying my first Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks in Seattle downtown  #PSL, @Starbucks",
    "image_url" : "https://imgurl.com/1234"
}
```

**Question to the class: What data points you can extract from above tweet?      Which is structured / unstructured?**

## Deciding Between Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL)

- This is not an easy decision, but here are some factors to think about

- Have structured data?  Then both ML and DL can be used

- Got unstructured data?  Probably deep learning

- Do keep in mind, deep learning usually needs
    - lot of data
    - and lot of compute time   
    to produce good results
