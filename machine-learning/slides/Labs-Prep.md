 *  **Instructor**

 * Ask students to access Jupyter Labs environment

 * Provide username and password

 * If port 8888 doesn't work, highly likely it is a network issue.  Try the following
     - Disable any VPN software on student's laptop
     - Connect to 'guest' network
     - Try connecting via 'mobile hotspot'

## Labs Prep - Step 3: Distribute Lab Bundle to Students

 *  **To instructor:**
    - cd to  ml-labs-xxx-yyy
    - Run  ./package-labs.sh
    - This will create a zip file with notebooks and the html content
    - Distribute this bundle to students
    - **Explain the difference between .md, .ipynb, .html files**

 *  **To students**
     - You can open html files in browser to see lab instructions
     - If you have Jupyter environment setup, you can run   
     `./run-jupyter.sh`   
     and view the notebooks
