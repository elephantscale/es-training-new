## Labs Prep - Step 2: Test Jupyter


 *  **Instructor**

 * Ask students to access Jupyter Labs environment

 * Provide username and password

 * If port 8888 doesn't work, highly likely it is a network issue.  Try the following

     - Disable any VPN software on student's laptop

     - Connect to 'guest' network

     - Try connecting via 'mobile hotspot'

## Labs Prep - Step 3: Distribute Lab Bundle to Students

 *  **To instructor:**

 * cd to  ml-labs-xxx-yyy

 * Run  ./package-labs.sh

 * This will create a zip file with notebooks and the html content

 * Distribute this bundle to students

 *  **Explain the difference between *.md, *.ipynb, *.html files**

 *  **To students**

 * Students can open *.html files in browser to see lab instructions

 * If they have Jupyter environment setup, they can run ./run-jupyter.sh and view the notebooks
