## FE: Group Discussion

  * **Problem:**
    - A comment is left on the website.  Determine if it is a 'spam' comment or legitimate comment

  * **Data we have:**
    - Comment text
    - IP address of user

  * **Discuss:**
    - What other data you may need to determine if the comment is 'spam' ?
    - How can we acquire the data?

## FE: Dealing With Time

  * Usually timestamps are stored in two formats:
    - Human readable format: '2017-02-01 14:10:45 PST'
    - Unix timestamp: 1489792175 (time elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00)
  * Sometimes we need to 'slice / dice' timestamp

  * Hypothesis:  
  "On Facebook users click on photos more during lunch time"
    - Include 'time of day' on model calculation

  * Some other interesting attributes:
    - 'time of day'  (work hours,   after hours)
    - 'day of week'  (Mon / Tue / Wed â€¦   work day  / weekend)

  * **Question for class:**
    - Any other time based behavior?
