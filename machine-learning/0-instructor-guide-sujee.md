# Instructor Guide: Machine Learning -- Sujee

## Before Class

- Prepare a background survey.  On Google or Survey Monkey
- Prepare a pre/post tests if required

### Lab Env:

We have been using Google Colab successfully.  No need to spin up VMs

## Teaching / Timings

### day 1
- administer PRE test

- ML Primer - 1hr
  - start with a Overview video
        - Google's view on Machine Learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcqpanDadyQ
  - demos
        - after GPU/CPU discussion :
            - Nvidia self driving car : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rc4RqYLtEU
            - AUDI self driving car :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjAJnQoNdMA
              (point out learning rate of brain vs. CPU vs. GPU around 50 second mark)

        - Reinforcement learning
            - Google Deep Mind - ATARI - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk
