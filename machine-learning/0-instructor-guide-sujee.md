## Before Class

- Prepare a background survey. On Google or Survey Monkey
- Prepare a pre/post tests if required

## ML with Python

* We have been using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) successfully.  No need to spin up VMs

Notes:

---
## ML With Spark

* Need cloud VMs

# Timing Guide

* This is just an approximate guide from my experience. Use it as a guideline and adjust accordingly.
