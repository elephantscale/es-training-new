# Instructor Guide: Machine Learning -- Sujee

## Before Class

- Prepare a background survey.  On Google or Survey Monkey
- Prepare a pre/post tests if required

## Lab Env

We have been using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) successfully.  No need to spin up VMs

## Timing Guide

This is just an approximate guide from my experience.  Use it as a guideline and adjust accordingly.

### day 1

* administer PRE test (if required)
