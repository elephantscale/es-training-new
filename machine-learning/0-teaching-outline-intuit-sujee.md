# Machine Learning Teaching Outline -- Sujee

## day 1
- Creating an AWS account : 
Step 1 : Ask students to create a learning account at
    https://devportal.intuit.com/
    - Go to 'hosting' menu
    - And 'create account'

Step 2 - make sure they check their quota so they can run 'c4.xlarge', 'm4.xlarge'  'p2.xlarge' machines.  They may have to request an increase in their quota.
    
- administer PRE test & background survey

- (optional) very quick spark primer (Spark-intro) - 30 mins

- start with a Overview video
        - Googleâ€™s view on Machine Learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcqpanDadyQ

- ML Primer - 1hr
    demos
        - after GPU/CPU discussion :
