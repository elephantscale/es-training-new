# Machine Learning Teaching Outline -- Sujee
---

## Day 1

* Creating an AWS account:
  
* Step 1: Ask students to create a learning account at https://devportal.intuit.com/

    - Go to 'hosting' menu
    - And 'create account'

* Step 2 - make sure they check their quota so they can run 'c4.xlarge', 'm4.xlarge'  'p2.xlarge' machines. They may have to request an increase in their quota.
    
    - administer PRE test & background survey
    - (optional) very quick spark primer (Spark-intro) - 30 mins
    - start with a Overview video
       - Google's view on Machine Learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcqpanDadyQ

* ML Primer - 1hr
