## About This Class

* A **practical approach to ML**

* Goals
    - **'Top-Down' learning**
    - **Learn** fundamentals of ML
    - And **implement** them in an ML environment

* Beyond the scope
    - Deep Math / Stats coverage
    - Advanced concepts

Notes:

---

## Prerequisites & Expectations

* Python development experience

* Familiarity with Spark

* We don't expect Math / Statistics background

* This is an **Introductory** class.
    - No previous knowledge of ML is assumed

Notes:

---

## What if I Don't Know Enough Math / Stats?

* Most often people are told to start Machine Learning with Linear Algebra / Calculus
    - These are hard subjects and lot of people loose interest pretty quickly
    - Or people spend too much time in Math / Stats

* Our approach:
    - We acknowledge Math / Stats are essential inner workings of Machine Learning
    - A practitioner can go far in ML with a little fundamentals and without too deep knowledge in Math / Stats

* **Learn by practicing**
    - We do recommend you review the theories behind ML at your leisure

* Enable you to be a **'ML Engineer'** by giving you
    - The essential knowledge of ML
    - Plenty of time and playground environment for learning the API
    - Show how to evaluate, test, and tweak the models
    - Expose you to useful tools

* Emphasis on concepts & fundamentals, not API

* Highly interactive (questions, discussions ..etc  are welcome)

* Hands-on - lots and lots of labs! (learn by doing)

Notes:

* All the labs are verified at 1.3 even though latest is 1.4

    - Uber Trips data
    - Walmart Shopping data
    - Netflix recommendation
    - Credit card default data
    - Prosper loan data
    - NYSE Stock data
