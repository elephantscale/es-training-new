# Spark ML Outline for Visa - 4 days
---

## This class caters to for both data engineers and data scientists.

* DEs know Spark and want to learn ML.  
* DSs know ML and want to learn Spark
* So it is a balancing act.  

* The course is 50% Spark and 50% ML.

* Advanced topic coverage is always welcome. So make some time to go over advanced topics , harder labs.

* Each session is half day
