# Spark ML Outline for Visa - 4 days

This class caters to for both data engineers and data scientists.

DEs know Spark and want to learn ML.  
DSs know ML and want to learn Spark
So it is a balancing act.  

The course is 50% Spark and 50% ML.

Advanced topic coverage is always welcome.  So make some time to go over advanced topics , harder labs.

Each session is half day
