# Effective Prompting Techniques for Language Models

---
## Slide 1
### Introduction
* Topic: Effective Prompting Techniques for Language Models
* Focus:
    * Principles of clear communication with AI models
    * Tactics to improve AI interaction
    * Practical examples and structured outputs

---
## Slide 2
### Principle 1: Write Clear and Specific Instructions
* Avoid short or vague prompts.
* Provide detailed and unambiguous instructions.
* Benefits:
    * Better context understanding.
    * More accurate and relevant responses.

---
## Slide 3
### Principle 1 Tactic 1: Use Delimiters
* Delimiters clearly indicate distinct parts of the input.
* Examples:
    * Backticks: ```
    * Quotes: """ or ""
    * Tags: `<tag>` and `</tag>`
* Code Example:
  ```python
  text = """..."""
  prompt = "Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks..."
  ```

---
## Slide 4
### Principle 1 Tactic 2: Ask for Structured Output
* Request output in formats like JSON or HTML.
* Code Example:
  ```python
  prompt = """
  Generate three book titles with authors and genres in JSON format.
  """
  ```
* Benefit:
    * Makes parsing and automation easier.

---
## Slide 5
### Principle 1 Tactic 3: Check Conditions
* Ensure AI validates requirements.
* Example:
    * Rewriting a recipe into structured steps.
* Code Example:
  ```python
  prompt = """
  Rewrite instructions as Step 1, Step 2, ...
  """
  ```

---
## Slide 6
### Principle 1 Tactic 4: Few-shot Prompting
* Provide examples in the prompt to guide the model.
* Example:
  ```python
  prompt = """
  <child>: Teach me about resilience.
  <grandparent>: Example response here.
  """
  ```

---
## Slide 7
### Principle 2: Give the Model Time to “Think”
* Encourage multi-step problem-solving.
* Specify logical steps explicitly.
* Example Tasks:
    * Summarization.
    * Translation.
    * Counting items in text.

---
## Slide 8
### Principle 2 Tactic 1: Multi-step Instructions
* Example:
  ```python
  prompt = """
  1. Summarize the text.
  2. Translate into French.
  3. List names in the summary.
  4. Provide output in JSON format.
  """
  ```
* Benefit:
    * Reduces errors in complex tasks.

---
## Slide 9
### Principle 2 Tactic 2: Self-Verification
* Ask the model to solve the problem and compare.
* Example:
  ```python
  prompt = """
  Solve the problem yourself and compare with the student's solution.
  """
  ```
* Application:
    * Validation of reasoning and results.

---
## Slide 10
### Model Limitations: Hallucinations
* Example:
    * "AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie" - invented product.
* Key Insight:
    * Cross-check AI outputs for factual accuracy.

---
## Slide 11
### Experimentation
* Try new prompts and variations.
* Adjust based on output quality.
* Keep refining to achieve clarity and relevance.
