## Andrew Ng at University of Exeter’s Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy.
* The name of this faculty stood out to me as a particularly forward-looking way to organize an academic division. 
* Having Computer Science sit alongside Environmental Science and the Business School creates natural opportunities for 
* collaboration across these fields.

## Andrew abot the University

  * This is not a group whose primary worry is whether students will cheat using AI. 
  * This is a group that is thinking about how to create a student body that is empowered through AI, 
  * whether by teaching more students to code, helping them use AI tools effectively, 
  * or showing them what’s newly possible in their disciplines.
