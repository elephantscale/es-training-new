## What will happen instead?

## Andrew Ng at University of Exeter’s Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy.
* The name of this faculty stood out to me as a particularly forward-looking way to organize an academic division. 
* Having Computer Science sit alongside Environmental Science and the Business School creates natural opportunities for 
* collaboration across these fields.

## Andrew abot the University

  * This is not a group whose primary worry is whether students will cheat using AI. 
  * This is a group that is thinking about how to create a student body that is empowered through AI, 
  * whether by teaching more students to code, helping them use AI tools effectively, 
  * or showing them what’s newly possible in their disciplines.

## Future
* Just as every company is becoming an AI company, every university must become an AI university
* Not just teaching AI, but using it to advance every field of study. 
* This doesn’t mean abandoning disciplinary expertise. 
* It means maintaining technical excellence while ensuring AI enhances every field.
