## What is malware analysis

* Malware is a code that performs malicious actions
* it can take the form of an executable, script, code, or any other software.
* Attackers use malware to 
  * steal sensitive information 
  * spy on the infected system 
  * take control of the system
* Typically, gets into your system without your consent
  * can be delivered via various communication channels 
    * email
    * web
    * USB drives.

## What goes into Malware analysis

* Malware analysis
  * types of malware analysis
  * and setting up an isolated malware analysis lab environment.

* Static Analysis
  * tools and techniques to extract metadata information from the malicious binary
  * compare and classify malware samples
  * how to determine various aspects of the binary  without executing it.

* Dynamic Analysis
  * tools and techniques to determine the behavior of the malware
  * how to obtain the network and host-based indicators associated with the malware.

## Why Malware Analysis?

* To determine the nature and purpose of the malware
  * determine whether malware is an information stealer, HTTP bot, spam bot, rootkit, keylogger, etc.
* How the system was compromised and its impact
* Network indicators associated with the malware
  * malware contacts a particular domain/IP address?
  * create a signature and monitor the network traffic

## Types Of Malware Analysis
* Static analysis
  * analyzing a binary without executing it
* Dynamic analysis (Behavioral Analysis)
  * executing the suspect binary in an isolated environment
* Static analysis
  * Static
  * Dynamic
    * debugging the suspect binary in a controlled manner to understand its functionality
* Memory analysis (Memory forensics)
  * analyzing the computer's RAM for forensic artifacts
