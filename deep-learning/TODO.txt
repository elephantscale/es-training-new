        Look at model.evaluate()

=====
- DL Concepts

    - Add a quiz at the end

    - lab place holders at the end of part 1

=======

DL-Neural Net
    - expand on network sizing, wiht examples on regression, binary classification, softmax



=====
KERAS Intro
    - insert lab

    - optimizes revisit and make sure we have the correct api and text  ("adam")

    - keras example of regression and classification



=====================================

DL-LSTMs.md
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21

    - add animations

    - best video explanation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=8HyCNIVRbSU

========

deep-learning-labs
    - add model.plot to all notebooks
    - fix first hidden layer being called 'input_layer'

=====

DL-CNN
    - picture to illustrate convolution : scanning a painting with a flashlight.  Identifying features (oh I see a sword, I see a horse)

    - each neuron getting good at identifying features, like workers in the McDonald assembly line only do one thing (toast buns, put a burger patty on top, butter the buns ..etc)
