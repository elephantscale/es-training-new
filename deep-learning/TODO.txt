Ml Intro
    -  machien learning methodology
    - dupe walmart slide
    -

======

Tensorflow Intro
    - lab example of regression

    - lab holder

=====
- DL Concepts
    - flow isn't smooth
    
    - TODO : a diagram on illustrating where activation function is used

    - add a basic training data flow

    - use house prices as an example above
        - guess 200k... off by -100k go back... guess 250k... off by -50k go back... guess 290k.. .off by -10k... accepted

    - this is before epoch / batch / iteration

    - use the analogy of a restaurant serving food for a table of guests,
    they have to make every one reasonably happy...
    not just one person
    back propagation is like sending the food back... until it is cooked close to perfection

    - Revisit loss / error section

    - revisit activation functions


    - Add a quiz at the end

    - do part-1 and part-2

    - lab place holders at the end of part 1

=======

DL-Neural Net
    - expand on network sizing, wiht examples on regression, binary classification, softmax



=====
KERAS Intro
    - insert lab

    - optimizes revisit and make sure we have the correct api and text  ("adam")

    - keras example of regression and classification



=====================================

DL-RNN.md
    - add ball prediction Example
    https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-recurrent-neural-networks-79e5eb8049c9

    - Add animations from above post

    - best video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHXXI4-IEns

=====================================

DL-LSTMs.md
    - https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21

    - add animations

    - best video explanation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=8HyCNIVRbSU

========

deep-learning-labs
    - add model.plot to all notebooks
    - fix first hidden layer being called 'input_layer'

=====

DL-CNN
    - picture to illustrate convolution : scanning a painting with a flashlight.  Identifying features (oh I see a sword, I see a horse)

    - each neuron getting good at identifying features, like workers in the McDonald assembly line only do one thing (toast buns, put a burger patty on top, butter the buns ..etc)
