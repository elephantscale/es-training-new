- Tensorflow-Intro
    - cleanup

- DL Concepts
    - flow isn't smooth

    - add a basic training data flow

    - use house prices as an example above
        - guess 200k... off by -100k go back... guess 250k... off by -50k go back... guess 290k.. .off by -10k... accepted

    - this is before epoch / batch / iteration

    - use the analogy of a restaurant serving food for a table of guests,
    they have to make every one reasonably happy...
    not just one person
    back propagation is like sending the food back... until it is cooked close to perfection

    - Revisit loss / error section

    - revisit activation functions


    - Add a quiz at the end

    - do part-1 and part-2
