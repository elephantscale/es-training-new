Ml Intro
    -  machien learning methodology
    - dupe walmart slide
    - 
    
======

Tensorflow Intro 
    - lab example of regression 
    
    - lab holder
    
=====
- DL Concepts
    - flow isn't smooth

    - add a basic training data flow

    - use house prices as an example above
        - guess 200k... off by -100k go back... guess 250k... off by -50k go back... guess 290k.. .off by -10k... accepted

    - this is before epoch / batch / iteration

    - use the analogy of a restaurant serving food for a table of guests,
    they have to make every one reasonably happy...
    not just one person
    back propagation is like sending the food back... until it is cooked close to perfection

    - Revisit loss / error section

    - revisit activation functions


    - Add a quiz at the end

    - do part-1 and part-2
    
=======

DL-Neural Net 
    - expand on network sizing, wiht examples on regression, binary classification, softmax



=====
KERAS Intro 
    - insert lab 
    
    - optimizes revisit and make sure we have the correct api and text  ("adam")

    - keras example of regression and classification



=====================================
