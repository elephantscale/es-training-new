    - cleanup

    - merge with Machine Learning Primer and delete

- DL Concepts
    - flow isn't smooth

    - add a basic training data flow

    - use house prices as an example above
        - guess 200k... off by -100k go back... guess 250k... off by -50k go back... guess 290k.. .off by -10k... accepted

    - this is before epoch / batch / iteration

    - use the analogy of a restaurant serving food for a table of guests,
    they have to make every one reasonably happy...
    not just one person
    back propagation is like sending the food back... until it is cooked close to perfection

    - Revisit loss / error section

    - revisit activation functions

    - optimizers
    use mini golf game as example
    hit the ball off to an angle, optimizer corrects it
    then right angle.. hit it too short... optimizer adds a little more power

    - Add a quiz at the end

    - double check equations and replace them graphics

    - NOTE: In this case, using the RMSprop optimization algorithm is preferable to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), because RMSprop automates learning-rate tuning for us. (Other optimizers, such as Adam and Adagrad, also automatically adapt the learning rate during training, and would work equally well here.)

    - do part-1 and part-2

    - convert optimizer formulas to images
