Week 4 Quiz
TOTAL POINTS 7
1.Question 1
Using Image Generator, how do you label images?

1 point

You have to manually do it


It’s based on the file name


It’s based on the directory the image is contained in


TensorFlow figures it out from the contents

2.Question 2
What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?

1 point

rescale


normalize


Rescale_image


normalize_image

3.Question 3
How did we specify the training size for the images?

1 point

The target_size parameter on the training generator


The training_size parameter on the validation generator


The training_size parameter on the training generator


The target_size parameter on the validation generator

4.Question 4
When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?

1 point

Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, and there should be 3 Convolutional Layers


There will be 300 images, each size 300, loaded in batches of 3


Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color


There will be 300 horses and 300 humans, loaded in batches of 3

5.Question 5
If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?

1 point

You’re underfitting on your validation data


You’re overfitting on your training data


You’re overfitting on your validation data


No risk, that’s a great result

6.Question 6
Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:

1 point

In these images, the features may be in different parts of the frame


There’s a wide variety of horses


There’s a wide variety of humans


All of the above

7.Question 7
After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?

1 point

There was more condensed information in the images


The training was faster


We removed some convolutions to handle the smaller images


There was less information in the images
