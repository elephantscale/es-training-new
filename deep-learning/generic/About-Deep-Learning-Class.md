# Deep Learning With TensorFlow & Keras

---

## About This Class

* A **practical approach to Deep Learning**

* Goals
    - **'Top-Down' learning**
    - **Learn** fundamentals of DL
    - And **implement** them in an DL environment

* Beyond the scope
    - Deep Math / Stats coverage

Notes:

## Pre-requisites and Expectations

* Basic Python knowledge is assumed

* Have a Python development environment
   - We will set this up in class
 
* We don't expect Math / Statistics background

* Curiosity! Ask a lot of questions 

* This is a **Intro** Deep Learning class
    - No previous knowledge is assumed
    - Class will be based on the pace of majority of the students
