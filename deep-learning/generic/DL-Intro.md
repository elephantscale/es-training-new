- Can do supervised and unsupervised learning

- Getting very popular due to availability of huge amount of data and vast compute power

# Deep Learning History

---


## Early AI (1950s – 1980s):  Rule-Based Approaches

 * Early AI approaches were largely rule-based.

 * Example: Natural Language Processing:

     - Tended to follow grammatical/linguistic processing rules.

     - Problem: Natural Language proved very difficult to unambiguously interpret.

 * Predicate Logic / Rules Engines

     - Based on Mathematical Theorem provers  / Logic

     - Represent knowledge as declarative statements

     - Able to achieve success in very limited domains of knowledge.

Notes:



---
## Machine Learning

 * Machine Learning arose as an alternative to traditional AI

 * Focused initially on purely statistical approaches.

 * Able to achieve very good results on problems that were not easy to solve with rule-based approaches.

 * ML is a data-driven approach:

     - Making inferences from Data

Notes:


---
## Neural Networks

 * Neural Networks Have a long history in Machine Learning

 * 1980s-1990s: Neural Networks invented to pattern the human brain.

 * Early attempts to make a general-purpose learning algorithm largely failed.

 * Backpropagation training algorithm saw some success.

## AI Winter (1980s / 1990s)

* In 1990s, Neural networks fell out of favor.
     - AI in general was perceived as pie-in-the-sky/academic
     - "Expert Systems" and "Rules Engines" found only niche applications.

* Neural Networks Received Criticism
     - Too hard to train
     - Resulting Model not transparent enough.
     - Not suitable for large datasets
     - “Toy Problems”


Notes:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter
---

## AI Winter - Parallelization Challenges

- High Performance Computing (HPC) was all about parallelization

- NN considered hard to parallelize.

-  Compute Power was insufficient for the time

- Training Datasets were insufficiently sized for good results.

Notes:


---
## Surge of Statistical Machine Learning

 * Statistical Machine Learning became the method of choice

 * Well Understood (Applied Statistics)

 * Achieved impressive results compared to previous rule-based approaches

 * Ensemble Methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) gave impressive results.

 * Resultant Models often fairly transparent

     - Example: Credit scoring algorithms: Have to unambiguously show WHY the model gives the result it does.

## Deep Learning Right Now

* In the modern era, Deep Learning has been successful.  The following factors made it possible

-  **'Big Data**' – now we have so much data to train our models

-  **'Big Data ecosystem**' – excellent big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL) are available as open source

-  **'Big Compute**'  -  **cloud**  platforms significantly lowered the barrier to massive compute power
    - $1 rents you a `16 core + 128 G + 10 Gigabit` machine for 1 hr on AWS! So running a 100 node cluster for 5 hrs $500

- **Advances in hardware** (see next slides)

- **Advances in Algorithms**

- **Availability of pre-trained models**

Notes:

## Hardware Advances: CPU & GPU

- Recently GPUs – Graphics Processing Units - have become popular (especially in Deep Learning)

- GPU cores are good at compute intensive calculations (math, matrix operations)

- Each GPU core is capable of executing small set instructions, but there are 1000s of core per GPU
Running in parallel

## Advances in Deep Learning Research

- In recent years, lot of money is chasing Deep Learning

- Companies like Google / Facebook / Amazon are in an 'arms race' to hire the best talent in AI

- Lot of research going on in public / private sectors

- Organizations like OpenAI are fostering research in public domain

---
## Creating Deep Learning Models Have Become Easier

- Historically, neural network models had to be coded from scratch
    - Converting math into code, testing and debugging
    - This could take weeks or months

- **Now tooling and libraries have gotten so much better**
    - High level tools like Keras and efficient libraries like Tensorflow, allow us to code complex models very quickly

---
## Availability of Pre-Trained Models

> "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"  
>  -- Isaac Newton

<img src="../../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/standing-on-shoulders.jpg" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;float:right;max-width:100%;" width="20%" />


- Creating complex models takes lot of data and lot of training
    - this can take huge amount of compute power (days or weeks of training)

- Now, we don't have to start from scratch

- There are lot of high quality models that are open source.  We can start with them and tweak them to fit our needs

- _This is probably the biggest reason DL has become mainstream_

- See example on next slide

---

## Model Zoos

<img src="../../assets/images/deep-learning/zoo1.png" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;max-width:100%;float:right;" width="50%" />

- Building and training complex models from scratch takes a lot of effort and compute

- Luckily, there are lot models available publicly  
    - Computer vision models : LeNet, AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Inception

- Available model zoos
    - [Tensorflow model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
    - [Caffe model zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo)



---


## Building on Other Models

- Say we want to develop a model that can classify people into male / female

- Rather than starting from scratch, we can start with a model that can recognize peopole

- And then train it more to classify them into male/female

---

# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

---

## Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

- Machine learning is usually used with 'structured data' (CSV files etc.)

- Deep learning can handle both structured (e.g. csv) and unstructured data (e.g. Image files, Video files)

## Deep Learning and Big Data

 * Until recently most of the machine learning is done on “single computer” (with lots of memory–100s of GBs)

 * Most R/Python/Java libraries are “single node based”

 * Now Big Data tools make it possible to run machine learning algorithms at massive scale–distributed across a cluster

## Deep Learning in Mobile

- Why do DL on mobile?
- **Privacy** : so no data leaves the device.  This is important with PII (Personaly Identifiable Information) and Europe's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Reducing Cloud Cost** : By doing DL on the device and minimizing sending data to cloud, we can save time and money
- **Speed** : Sending data to cloud and getting an answer back can take several seconds
    - 10 seconds : user's keep their focus on a screen
    - 1 second : to keep workflow going
    - 0.1 second : users perceive system is working 'instantaneously'
