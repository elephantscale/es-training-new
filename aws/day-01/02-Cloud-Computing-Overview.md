## What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a technology that allows individuals and businesses to access and store data, run applications, and utilize computing resources
over the internet without needing to own or maintain physical hardware.

Cloud computing enables you to <span style="color:red">stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware</span>, and instead
<span style="color:green">think of it (and use it) as software.</span>

---

## What Is Cloud Computing?

Hardware solutions are physical. This means they require:

- Space
- Staff
- Physical security
- Planning
- Capital expenditure

And what if your needs change?

You have to go through the time, effort, and cost required to change all of the above.

---

## What Is Cloud Computing?

**Software is flexible.**

If your needs change, your software can change much more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than your hardware.


---

## The **Cloud** Metaphor

Imagine storing your files in a distant warehouse instead of your local computer. Anytime you need a file, you can just request it, and it's delivered
to you over the internet.

That warehouse is the **cloud**

## In simple terms

* Get as many resources as you need
* In a matter of minutes
* Only pay for what you use

# History of ...

---

## 1960s

- DARPA funded the development of a computer which could be simultaneously used by multiple users
- John McCarthy's suggests in a speech at MIT that computing can be sold like a utility, just like water or electricity.
- American computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider presents an idea for an interconnected system of computers, later implemented in the development of
  ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) - the precursor of modern Internet.
- Douglas F. Parkhill predicts that the computer industry will become a public utility “in which many remotely located users are connected via
  communication links to a central computing facility.”

---

## 1970s

- The concept of virtual machines (VMs) is created to allow running a completely different computer (virtual machine) inside a desktop operating
  system. This allows for more efficient use of hardware resources.

- IBM releases the first version if its VM operating system

- The cloud symbol is used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET.

---

## 1980s

- The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) launches an initiative to build a national backbone network that would be based on transmission control
  protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)

- The first Ethernet adapter card for the IBM personal computer is released, introducing fast, inexpensive connections that would enable cloud
  computing

- A National Science Foundation Network project creates network access to the supercomputer sites in the United States
  Commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) begin to emerge

---

## 1990s

- World Wide Web invented

- The term 'cloud' is used for virtualized services by General Magic

- Early cloud models implemented by iland (IaaS), CallidusCloud (SaaS), Rackspace and Salesforce

- References to the phrase "cloud computing" appear with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document

- Ramnath Chellappa defines cloud as a “computing paradigm where the boundaries of computing will be determined by economic rationale rather than
  technical limits alone.”

- German Math Society presented a concept of Basic Support for Collaborative Work

---

## 2000s

- The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is introduced as an IaaS that lets organizations contract for computers to run their applications with the
  ability to programmatically create and terminate instances that gives developers the flexibility to write their own code for autoscaling

- Google CEO Eric Schmidt introduces the term "cloud computing" to an industry conference. “What’s interesting now is that there is an emergent new
  model, (..) I don’t think people have really understood how big this opportunity really is. It starts with the premise that the data services and
  architecture should be on servers. We call it cloud computing—they should be in a “cloud” somewhere.”

- Amazon creates Amazon Web Services as a subsidiary to provide on-demand cloud computing platforms, and introduces its Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)

---

## 2000s

- Amazon decided to use their service-oriented architecture and the services designed to cope with large and fluctuating numbers of users, and
  transform it into a product that could be offered to outside customers.

- For Amazon, that meant that peak loads would be distributed among all of the users of their infrastructure.

- The scaling effects of the cloud services thus became the key selling point of cloud computing

- A prerequisite for efficient cloud computing services is a fast broadband connection, with high bandwidth and low latency.
    - With such connectivity, it makes no difference whether data is stored locally on a PC, or in remote servers in a cloud

---

---

## Multi-Cloud

- **Multi-cloud** means that you or your company are not only using the services of one cloud provider, but are also using different solutions from
  different cloud providers.


- Examples include using Microsoft Office 365 for business collaboration, Salesforce for customer relationship management, and AWS Route 53 for
  GeoDNS and GeoIP.

---

## Multi-Cloud

- **Redundancy:** You don't want to build your environment on only one cloud provider, because one can fail, as has happened with AWS in the past.

- So, you want to keep the business running with the services of the other cloud providers.

- This is mostly related to using IaaS or PaaS.

- For the most part, redundancy is not possible with SaaS if the cloud provider does not support hybrid environments.

---

## Concluding Thoughts & The Future

- **Strategic Choices:** Organizations should choose based on cost, security, compliance, and scalability needs.
- **Future Evolution:** Continuous evolution with the advancement of technologies and business needs.
- **Emerging Concepts:** Edge computing, distributed cloud, and more are influencing deployment strategies.
