## What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a technology that allows individuals and businesses to access and store data, run applications, and utilize computing resources
over the internet without needing to own or maintain
physical hardware.

## The **Cloud** Metaphor

Imagine storing your files in a distant warehouse instead of your local computer. Anytime you need a file, you can just request it, and it's delivered
to you over the internet.

That warehouse is the **cloud**
