# AWS Well-Architected Framework
---

## Introduction to the Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient applications.

It provides a consistent approach to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

It provides a set of questions developed by AWS experts to helps customers think critically about their architecture.

It asks, "Does your infrastructure follow best practices?"

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework

Architects should leverage the AWS Well-Architected Framework in order to:

- Increase awareness of architectural best practices.

- Address foundational areas that are often neglected.

- Evaluate architectures using a consistent set of principles.

---

## The AWS Well-Architected Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework **does not** provide:

- Implementation details

- Architectural patterns

- Relevant case studies

However, it **does** provide:

- Questions centered on critically understanding architectural decisions

- Services and solutions relevant to each question

- References to relevant resources

## Five Pillars of the Framework

The Framework is based on five pillars:

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

---

## Operational Excellence

This pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value.

Emphasizes the importance of :

- Documentation
- Procedures
- understanding changes

---

## Security Pillar

This pillar focuses on protecting information and systems.

<span style="text-align:left">The ability to protect:</span>

- Information
- Systems
- Assets

While delivering business value through:

- Risk assessments
- Mitigation strategies



---

## Reliability Pillar

This pillar focuses on ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.

The ability of a system to:

- Recover from infrastructure or service failures
- Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand

Mitigate disruptions such as:

- Misconfigurations
- Transient network issues

---

## Performance Efficiency

This pillar focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

The ability to:

- Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements
- Maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve

---

## Cost Optimization

This pillar focuses on avoiding unneeded costs.

The ability to avoid or eliminate:

- Unneeded cost
- Suboptimal resources
