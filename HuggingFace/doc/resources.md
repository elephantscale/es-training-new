11. What possible source can the bias observed in a model have?
    The model is a fine-tuned version of a pretrained model and it picked up its bias from it.
    Correct! When applying Transfer Learning, the bias in the pretrained model used __perspires__ in the fine-tuned model.

Not perspires but transpires
