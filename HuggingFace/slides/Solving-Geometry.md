## Demis Hassabis, a wunderkind from North London
* Learned chess moves at 4
* After two weeks, his father couldn't beat him
* Created games of Reversi AI at 11
* Won a place at Cambridge at 15 but had to wait for a year
* In that year, created "Theme Park"

## Proving mathematical theorems 
* Proving mathematical theorems at the olympiad level represents a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning
* AlphaGeometry is a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry
* Sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs
* AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system 
  * uses a neural language model
  * trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data
  * to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems

## Performance
* On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems
* AlphaGeometry solves 25
* Outperforms the previous best method that only solves ten problems
* Approaches the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. 
* AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs
* Solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015
