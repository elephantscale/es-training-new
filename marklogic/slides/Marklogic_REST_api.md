# Introduction to the MarkLogic REST API

## Capabilities of the REST Client API

* The REST Client API is a RESTful interface for building client applications.

* The capabilities of the API include the following:

    - Create, retrieve, update, and delete documents, metadata, and semantic triples in a MarkLogic database.

    - Search documents and semantic graphs and query lexicon values, using several query formats, including string query, structured query, combined query, Query by Example (QBE), and SPARQL.

## Capabilities of the REST Client API (cont...)
*
     - Customize your queries by configuring dynamic and/or persistent query options.

    - Apply transformations to document contents and search results.

    - Extend the API to expose custom capabilities you author in XQuery and install on MarkLogic Server.

* You can use the REST Client API to work with XML, JSON, text, and binary documents

## Capabilities of the REST Client API (cont...)

* In most cases, your application can use either XML or JSON to exchange non-document data such as queries and search results with MarkLogic Server.

* REST API client applications interact with MarkLogic Server through a REST API instance, a specially configured HTTP App Server

* Each REST API instance is intended to service a single content database and client application

* You can create and configure a REST API instance via a REST request or interactively

## Getting Started with the MarkLogic REST API

* This section leads you through a simple example that uses the REST Client API to insert documents into a database and perform a search.

* We will follow these steps:

    - Preparation
    - Choose a REST API Instance
    - Load Documents Into the Database
    - Search the Database
    - Tear Down the REST API Instance

## Preparation

* Before beginning this walkthrough, you should have the following software installed:

    - MarkLogic Server

    - curl, a command line tool for issuing HTTP requests, or an equivalent tool.

* Though the examples rely on curl, you can use any tool or library capable of sending HTTP requests. If you are not familiar with curl or do not have curl on your system
