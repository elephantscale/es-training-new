## Let's Draw

* The teacher explains how [Quick Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) works
* Lets the students play and complete a game
* Then show the 50 million drawings already accumulated
* Points out the the trend is to collect all user-input data (next cartoon)
* And explains how the algorithm works
  - Quick Draw selects a shape out of all that it knows
  - Asks a person to draw exactly that shapes
  - Invokes a software that can recognize this or close shapes

## BERT Software
* Demonstrate an article on the screen (to avoid image copyright issues)
* Here is [the link](https://medium.com/syncedreview/baidus-ernie-tops-google-s-bert-in-chinese-nlp-tasks-d6a42b49223d)
* Explain how BERT is trained
  - Send computer to middle and hight school
  - Teach it to understand basic English by 
    - taking some words out of the text
    - then playing with the text to restore the words
    - this is self-supervised learning
* Then finish it up by telling it how to
  - answer questions (Stanford test)
  - guess people's sentiments
  - or any language task

---
  
## BERT Lab
* Sentiment analysis tutorial for movie review
* Run the lab
* Let BERT guess the sentiment of a review
* Add your review
* See what BERT says
---


## Hackathon (Optional)
* Divide into teams
* Give teams names
  - Eagles, Beavers, Little Rock, Houston, etc.
