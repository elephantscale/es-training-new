 * AI is no longer 'novel'

 * Companies are expected to have some AI in their products

     - Just like they are expected to have website that works on a phone

     - Or having an 'app'

## Use Case : Uber driver verification

- To increase passenger safety, Uber drivers have to verify their identity before accepting rides

- Uber uses [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to recognize 7 million+ drivers in milli seconds

- [Link](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/uberids.gif?resize=343%2C600&strip=all)

## Use Case: Photobucket

- [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/) is a image / video hosting service

- They want to identify and tag NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images and offensive images

- Previously, their human moderation team was only able to monitor about 1% of content

- Now AI system (Using [Clarify](https://www.clarifai.com/)), screens images and tags them properly.  
Illegal images (child pornography ..etc) are flagged for law enforcement

## Use Case: Staples

- [Staples](https://www.staples.com) relies on organic search traffic to drive sales

- One way the ways to score high on search engine results is put meaningful ALT tags for each product images

- Doing it manually was an expensive proposition

- They use  [Clarify](https://www.clarifai.com/) to automatically tag images

* Problem
  - AirBnB is growing at an exponential rate

  - With growth, the customer support also increased

  - They had 5000 support agents, and still falling behind!

  - Needed a way to scale

* Solution

  - Deploy AI to handle customer queries

  - AI is smart enough to understand customer questions and provide answers"how do I verify my ID?"

* DeepMind's AI can detect over 50 eye diseases as accurately as a doctor

* Case study at London's Morefield's Hospital

* Typical eye diagnosis took 2 weeks

* AI can diagnose it in a flash

* How?
    - The AI system was trained on hundreds of thousands of previous eye scans and their diagnosis
    - Once it has learned enough then when it sees a new image, it can predict the outcome
    - 90%+ accuracy

## Expert Systems

* **An expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert**

* They reason through scenarios using the built-in knowledge

* Expert systems are **rule based**

* Rules are **static** and created by domain experts

<img src="../../assets/images/AI/expert-systems-1.png"  style="width:65%;"/><!-- {"left" : 0.78, "top" : 4.13, "height" : 3.28, "width" : 8.7} -->

## Expert Systems vs. Machine Learning

| Expert System                                  | Machine Learning                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rules are statically created by domain experts | Rules are 'learned' from data                                   |
| Uses rules / if-then to provide answers        | Uses models created from learning                               |
| Updating rules is an involved process          | Newer/better models can be created by training on more/new data |
| Not very scalable                              | Scales well with data                                           |
| Popular in 1980s                               | Currently popular approach                                      |
