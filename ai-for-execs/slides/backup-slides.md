## State of the Art in AI

* Last few years have seen tremendous advantages in  the following areas:

* **Computer Vision**:   
    - Trying to identify things in pictures
    - Sample models: ResNet, MobileNet

* **Language Processing**:  
    - Understanding 'free form' text (emails, word documents)
    - Sample models: BERT, Open-GPT

## Transfer Learning

* We don't need to build models from scratch anymore

* There are tremendous amount of high quality models that are released as open source

* Start with those base models and fine tune to fit your needs

- Demo: [Tensorflow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)
