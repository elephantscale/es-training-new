## What Is Data Science?


 * "Data-driven application development"

 * A new breed of discipline fueled by

     - Big data  (we have lot more data these days)

     - Lot of intelligence can be mined from this data

     - Technology revolutions like Hadoop & NoSQL that enabled Big Data processing possible

 * Involves multiple disciplines

     - Computer Science

     - Statistics etc.

 * "**More (quality) data** usually beats **better algorithms**"

 * Jeff Hammerbacher invented the term in 2012 while at Facebook

## Visualizations


 * How you tell the results - Very very important part!!

 * Good visualizations convey the point to the audience.

 * A good data scientist must learn good visualization techniques.

 * Standard graphs: line, bar, pie, ...

 * Modern visualizations: Heat maps, Animations (D3JS etc.)
