## Use Case: Photobucket

- [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/) is a image / video hosting service

- They want to identify and tag NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images and offensive images

- Previously, their human moderation team was only able to monitor about 1% of content

- Now AI system (Using [Clarify](https://www.clarifai.com/)), screens images and tags them properly.  
Illegal images (child pornography ..etc) are flagged for law enforcement

Me:
    Hi, My driver went to a wrong location.  
    So I had to cancel.  
    But I was charged a cancellation fee.
    Can that be refunded"`

* DeepMind's AI can detect over 50 eye diseases as accurately as a doctor

* Case study at London's Morefield's Hospital

* Typical eye diagnosis took 2 weeks

* AI can diagnose it in a flash

* How?
    - The AI system was trained on hundreds of thousands of previous eye scans and their diagnosis
    - Once it has learned enough then when it sees a new image, it can predict the outcome
    - 90%+ accuracy

# What is AI

## Definition of Machine Learning

<img src="../../assets/images/people/Arthur-Samuel.png" alt="Arthur-Samuel.png" style="width:15%;float:right;"/><!-- {"left" : 7.53, "top" : 1.21, "height" : 3.48, "width" : 2.46} -->

* **"The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."  -- Arthur Samuel (1959)**

* Example: Self-driving cars
    - Historical approach:  
    Write a massive program to instruct the car to handle all possible scenarios encountered while driving
        - This is immensely difficult

    - AI approach:  
        - Let AI learn by observing the scenery and your  reactions
        - Once it learnt enough, let the AI predict the next reaction for a scenary

## Spam Detection - Traditional (Rule Based) Approach

* Here is an example of spam detection rule engine

* The rules are coded by developers

* There could be 100s of 1000s of rules!

```java

if (email.from_ip.one_of("ip1", "ip2", "ip3")) {
	result = "no-spam"
}
else if ( email.text.contains ("free loans", "cheap degrees"))
{
	result = "spam"
}

```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 2.77, "height" : 1.96, "width" : 10.25} -->

Notes:




---

## Spam Detection - AI Approach


 * Show the algorithm with spam and non-spam emails

 * Algorithm 'learns' which attributes are indicative of spam

 * Then algorithm predicts spam/no-spam on new email

Notes:

## How is AI Different from Rule Based Systems


 * Rule based systems are static

     - They are programmed in

     - They don't learn from data

 * AI can learn from data

     - It gets better every day with more data it sees

## AI Starts with Data

- Lot of AI algorithms learn from data

- Generally, more data usually makes smarter algorithms
    - There are exceptions to this

## Learning From Data


- An machine learning algorithm learns from the above data, and then tries to predict house prices on new data


| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Predicted Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 2                   | 1900           | ???                                 |
| 4                  | 3                   | 2300           | ???                                 |

<!-- {"left" : 0.25, "top" : 3.16, "height" : 1.69, "width" : 9.75, "columnwidth" : [1.61, 1.86, 1.92, 4.36]} -->

---

## Learning Process

 *  **Phase 1: Training**
     - Algorithm learns from the data to create a model
     - This step can get computationally expensive.  
     Hours / days / weeks (this is why we use GPU / TPUs  and clusters of computers)
 *  **Phase 2: Prediction / Inference**
     - Once a model is created it can answer questions
        - "what would be the sale price for this house"
        - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - Prediction is very fast (milli seconds)

## Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

| Structured Data                                          | Unstructured Data                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data has well defined structure.                         | Structure is not well defined or non existing |
| Data in a database tables are well defined.  10 columns, first column is integer, second column is timestamp ..etc | videos, images                                             |

## Structured Data Examples

- Pretty much any data stored in a schema database

| Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Size | Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |

---

## Structured Data Examples

 * Text data (CSV, JSON) can have structure too

JSON data

```json
{   "name" : "Joe",
    "email" : "joe@gmail.com" }
```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 2.07, "height" : 0.46, "width" : 3.35} -->

CSV data (Comma Seperated Values)

```
joe,joe@gmail.com
jane,jane@gmail.com
```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 3.11, "height" : 0.67, "width" : 3.27} -->


---

## Unstructured Data Examples


- Text
    - Documents : email, word documents
    - Survey results (customer feedback)
    - customer support ticket notes

- Binary data
    - Audio (phone call recordings)
    - Images
    - Video (YouTube videos)

## Semi-Structured Data

 * This is 'between' structured and and unstructured

 * Data has some structure, but it may not be well defined

 * Example, tweet data

```json
{   "user_id" : "user123",
    "timestamp" : "2018-09-20 12:00:05 EST",
    "device" : "iPhone X",
    "location" : "34.893, 120.979",
    "tweet" : "Enjoying my first Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks in Seattle downtown  #PSL, @Starbucks",
    "image_url" : "https://imgurl.com/1234"
}
```
<!-- {"left" : 0, "top" : 3, "height" : 1.41, "width" : 10.25} -->
**Question to the class: What data points you can extract from above tweet?      Which is structured / unstructured?**

## Data And AI

- Majority of the machine learning projects use 'structured data'
    - predicting house prices, identifying credit card transactions ..etc.

- This will continue to grow as we get more and more data, and enterprises adopt more AI

- We are only able to make significant headways in processing unstructured data
    - images , videos

- This is largely due to the advances of neural nets

## Dos and Don'ts For Collecting Data for AI

AI starts with data, in this section we are going to look at some best practices

- How to acquire data

- How to curate/clean data

- How to deal with 'big data'

---

## Acquiring Data

- Best data is the one you already have or  can collect on your own
    - Data you already have in your database (e.g. customer data)
    - Website logs

- Data can be acquired from 'data brokers'
    - e.g. Stock market data

- Some data is free
    - e.g. Census data


---

## Data Responsibilities

- Usually IT team is responsible building the data infrastructure

- AI team 'uses' data  (they are IT team's clients)

- Mistake:  Spend a lot of time gathering data and then involve AI team
    - Not all data may be useful.  
    - Involve AI team early on, so they can give feedback on data


<img src="../../assets/images/AI/data-team-and-AI-team.png" alt="XXX image missing" style="max-width:100%;width:50%;" /><!-- {"left" : 1.33, "top" : 4.46, "height" : 3.56, "width" : 7.6} -->



---

## Dealing With Big Data

- Most machine learning doesn't necessarily need 'Big Data'
    - Even modest data can yield surprisingly decent results

- However, more data can significantly produce better results

* **"More data usually beats better algorithms"   
[Anand Rajaraman](https://anand.typepad.com/datawocky/2008/03/more-data-usual.html)  (Walmart Labs)**

- Traditionally structured data has been stored in databases

- How ever databases have their limitations:
    - they don't scale to huge data sizes
    - or they can be incredibly expensive to store large amount of data
    - they don't handle unstructured data well



---

## Big Data Systems

- Storing big data requires large 'cluster' systems

- Choices
    - On premise:  Hadoop
    - Cloud storage: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure storage

---

## Hadoop

- Hadoop was developed at Yahoo and open sourced around 2006

- Became 'the' platform for Big Data -- namely on premise

- Hadoop provides **distributed storage** and **distributed computing**

- Can scale upto 1000s of nodes

- Andrew Ng's  __"one second"__ rule  
"If you can do a task with less than ONE second of thought process, AI can do that easily"

- What AI can do now
    - Classifying email as spam / not spam
    - Translating english sentence to Japanese
    - Identifying an image (car vs boat)
    - Identify damaged products off assembly line
    - Customer support ticket routing
    - self driving car : figuring out what is in front of it
    - Identifying cancer cells from Xray image


---

## What AI Can not do

- **Complex tasks that combines multiple skills**
  - Do market research and write a report
- If you don't have enough data
    - if you train AI using 1000s of xray images it can learn to classify.  What if you only have handful of images?  
    AI may not be able to provide good results
- Understand human intension  
For example, if a construction worker is waving you to stop or continue?

- AI can do 'certain tasks', it may not be able to automate the whole work flow

- For example, let's say we are deploying AI to handle customer tickets.

- AI can easily 'route' tickets to appropriate queues and priorities
    - "Item arrived late, even though I paid for expedited shippping.  can I get a refund?" ==> Send it to 'refund' queue
    - "Item arrived damaged, can I return it?" ==> send it to 'return' queue

- What AI can not do  (the whole workflow):
    - Read the support ticket
    - call customer to confirm the issue
    - then issue a refund
    - update the sales register
---

## Some Thoughts on Evaluating  AI Projects

- Do you have enough data to get started?

- For example let's say you want to identify damaged products off the assembly line, do you have enough pictures of good items and damaged items?

## Some Thoughts on Evaluating  AI Projects

- An AI system can evaluate an MRI scan pretty quickly to determine if the patient has a tumor

- How ever it is not going to be able replace an trained oncologist, because they do lot of other things
    - train interns
    - consult with patients
    - evaluate equipments and treatments

- So an oncologist may deploy an AI system to help him with reviewing MRI scans quickly.  
So he/she can focus on other 'higher order' functions

- Pick a couple of potential AI projects that is applicable to you

- What kind of data do you need for machine learning?  
It may help to think along these lines
    -  Data we already have
    - Data we can collect
    - 3rd party data - FREE or minimal cost
    - 3rd party data - Premium

- What kind of data infrastructure do you have now?  Can it scale to handle future growth?

## A Brief History: Modelling After Neurons in Brain


 * The human brain is a bunch of interconnected neurons.
 * The neuron is like a "gate" - produces an output
 * Some neurons will only 'fire' if they see color red
 * Some neurons will only fire if they detect a shape of 'hexagon'
 * If both of these cells fire together the brain can intrepret that I am seeing a red stop sign

    * Weather is good
    * And a friend can join?

 * What is the outcome if
    * You can go by public transit
    * And a friend can

## Power of Neural Networks

- Think of Neurons like 'legos'

- Each neuron will do a little bit work   
But when you stack them and combine them together, they can model some really complex functions

- This is what makes them incredibly powerful

<img src="../../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/legos-1.jpg" alt="legos" style="width:30%; "/> &nbsp;  &nbsp; <!-- {"left" : 0.55, "top" : 4.62, "height" : 2.54, "width" : 3.38} -->

 * If the network has more than ONE hidden layer, it is called DEEP network (or more than 3 layers total including input an output)

 * More layers gives the network the ability to adopt complex data

 * How ever more layers take more time to train

## Neural Network Example

- Say we are trying to build a neural net to predict house prices

- Given a few inputs (Bedrooms, Bathrooms ..etc)  the network has to learn to predict the price

- If we provide enough data to the network, it will automatically learn the functions of each neuron !!

## How to do Machine Learning


 *  **1 - Problem Definition:** What are we trying to solve

 *  **2 - Collect data** More data we have, the better the algorithms become.  This data can come from internal logs (clickstreams) or external sources (credit scores of customers)

 *  **3 - Prepare Data** Raw data is hardly in a form to be used.  It needs to be cleansed, tagged and curated before ready to use

 *  **4 - Train a model** Feed the training data to model so it can learn

 *  **5 - Evaluate the model** Test the model accuracy

 *  **6 - Improve the model** Either by adding more training data, choosing a different algorithm

 *  **7 - Deploy the model**

Notes:




---

## 1 - Problem Definition


 * This may not be as easy as it seems

 * Known Knowns

     - Daily web traffic

 * Known Unknowns

     - What are most popular pages?

     - Do big connectors matter in a social graph?

 * Unknown Unknowns

     - Is there a connection between X and Y

     - Just do some quick & dirty graphs.

 * Identify `interesting segments`

 * Need to sample?  Or process entire data set?

 * Models need to be `verified`  / `validated`

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: build / train model

     - Test set: validate the model

 * Initially 70% training,  30% test

 * Tweak the dials to decrease training and increase validation.

 * Training set should represent data well enough.

## AI and Big Data

 * Until recently most of the AI work is done on `single computer`

 * Most R/Python/Java libraries are `single machine based`

 * Now Big Data tools make it possible to run AI algorithms at massive scale-distributed across a cluster

## Machine Learning vs. Big Data

| Traditional ML                                 | ML on Big Data                               |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| All (or most) data fits into single machine    | Data is distributed across multiple machines |
| Data almost / always in memory                 | Memory is scarce                             |
| Optimized for heavy iterative computes         | Optimized for single pass computes           |
| Maintains state between stages                 | stateless                                    |
| CPU bound                                      | IO bound (disk / network).                   |
| GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) seldom engaged | GPUs are utilized increasingly               |
