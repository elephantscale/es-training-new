```
Me: 
    Hi, My driver went to a wrong location.  
    So I had to cancel.  
    But I was charged a cancellation fee.
    Can that be refunded"`

Customer Service: 
    I see, this is your first cancellation in past 2 months.  
    We will refund you the money.Have a nice day!"`
```

# What is AI

Notes:

---

## Definition of Machine Learning

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Arthur-Samuel.png" alt="Arthur-Samuel.png" style="width:15%;float:right;"/>

> "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."  
>   -- Arthur Samuel (1959)


* Example: Self-driving cars
    - Historical approach:  
    Write a massive program to instruct the car to handle all possible scenarios encountered while driving 
        - This is immensely difficult

    - AI approach:  
        - Let AI learn by observing the scenery and your  reactions
        - Once it learnt enough, let the AI predict the next reaction for a scenary



Notes:


---

## Spam Detection - Traditional (Rule Based) Approach

* Here is an example of spam detection rule engine

* The rules are coded by developers

* There could be 100s of 1000s of rules!

```java

if (email.from_ip.one_of("ip1", "ip2", "ip3")) {
	result = "no-spam"
}
else if ( email.text.contains ("free loans", "cheap degrees"))
{
	result = "spam"
}

```

Notes:




---

## Spam Detection - AI Approach


 * Show the algorithm with spam and non-spam emails

 * Algorithm 'learns' which attributes are indicative of spam

 * Then algorithm predicts spam/no-spam on new email

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Approach.png" alt="AI-Approach.png" style="width:55%;"/>

Notes:


---

## How is AI Different from Rule Based Systems


 * Rule based systems are static

     - They are programmed in

     - They don't learn from data

 * AI can learn from data

     - It gets better every day with more data it sees

## Generic / Narrow AI

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence  (ANI)
<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Driver_free_car.png" alt="Driver_free_car.png" style="width:25%;float:right;"/>

- Focused on a specific tasks 
- Self driving, smart speaker, image recognition
- Tremendous progress in the last few years



### Artificial Generic Intelligence (AGI)
<img src="../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/terminator-1.jpg" alt="bank-of-america.png" style="width:25%;float:right;"/>

- AI can do anything a human can do 
- We are decades or hundreds of years away from this
- So no need to worry about killer robots yet :-)

# A Brief History of AI

---

## AI Evolution


 * Initial AI thinking was TOP DOWN (or symbolic logic)

 * Write a  **big, comprehensive**  program

     - Program  **all the rules**  (expert systems)

 * Problem:

     - Too many rules

     - Works only for specific domain, e.g. math theorems or chess

 * Success stories: playing chess at the grand master level

     - Domains with limited, clear rules

 * Not so successful: image recognition

Notes:


---

## Another AI Approach - Bottom Up



 * E.g. how babies learn to talk:

     - They don't start by learning the 'rules of the language'
     
     - Learn by example

 * Train computers the similar way
 
 * The focus shifts from  **logic to data**

 * More data --> smarter systems

 * Success stories

     - Image recognition

     - Language translation

     - Self-driving cars

Notes:


---

## AI Success Story : Translation - Early Approach

 * Creating a translation system (English <--> Japanese) involes the following

     - English dictionary + grammar rules

     - Japanese dictionary + grammar rules

     - Translation rules

 * Now the system is ready to translate

 * But this approach really doesn't work well:

     - Rules have too many exceptions

     - Context and subtle meanings are lost

 * Example : "Minister of agriculture" --> "Priest of farming"

Notes:


---

## Translation - AI Approach (Google Translate)


 * Google Translate switched to 'Google Brain' on Sept 2016

 * System learned from 'data'

 * AI based system improved the accuracy many times over

## A Glimpse of AI History

 * Sixties

     - Commercial computers & mainframes

     - Computers play chess

 * Eighties

     - Artificial intelligence (AI) get  **'oversold** ', doesn't live up to the promise and gets a bad rap

 * 21st century

     - Big Data changes it all

Notes:


---

## The Great AI Revival - 21st century (2010 on)


 * AI is going through a resurgence now

 *  **'Big Data** ' - now we have so much data to train our models

 *  **'Big Data ecosystem** ' - excellent big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL) are available as open source

 *  **'Big Compute** ' - **cloud**  platforms significantly lowered the barrier to massive compute power

     - $1 rents you 16 core + 128 G + 10 Gigabit machine for 1 hr on AWS!
     - So running a 100 node cluster for 5 hrs --> $500

 *  **Advances in hardware** - CPU / GPUs / TPUs

## Incredible Growth of AI Power


 * Since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.5 month-doubling time (by comparison, Moore's Law had an 18-month doubling period)Source: (https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/)
 * Phases:
     - Before 2012: It was uncommon to use GPUs for ML, making any of the results in the graph difficult to achieve.
     - 2012 to 2014: Infrastructure to train on many GPUs was uncommon, so most results used 1-8 GPUs rated at 1-2 TFLOPS for a total of 0.001-0.1 pfs-days.
     - 2014 to 2016: Large-scale results used 10-100 GPUs rated at 5-10 TFLOPS, resulting in 0.1-10 pfs-days. Diminishing returns on data parallelism meant that larger training runs had limited value.
     - 2016 to 2017: Approaches that allow greater algorithmic parallelism such as huge batch sizes, architecture search, and expert iteration, along with specialized hardware such as TPU's and faster interconnects, have greatly increased these limits, at least for some applications.

# AI and Data

---

## AI Starts with Data 

- Lot of AI algorithms learn from data 

- Generally, more data usually makes smarter algorithms 
    - There are exceptions to this 


---

## Learning From Data 

- Let's start with simple housing sales data 

| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Sale Price (in thousands) (we are trying to predict) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

- An machine learning algorithm learns from the above data, and then tries to predict house prices on new data 


| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Predicted Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 2                   | 1900           | ???                                 |
| 4                  | 3                   | 2300           | ???                                 |

---
## Learning Process

 *  **Phase 1 : Training**
     - Algorithm learns from the data to create a model
     - This step can get computationally expensive.  
     Hours / days / weeks (this is why we use GPU / TPUs  and clusters of computers)
 *  **Phase 2 : Prediction / Inference**
     - Once a model is created it can answer questions 
        - "what would be the sale price for this house"
        - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - Prediction is very fast (milli seconds)

## Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

| Structured Data                                          | Unstructured Data                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data has well defined structure.                         | Structure is not well defined or non existing |
| Data in a database tables are well defined.  10 columns, first column is integer, second column is timestamp ..etc | videos, images                                             |

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Structured-Data-Unstructured-Data.png" alt="Structured-Data-Unstructured-Data.png" style="width:40%;"/>
---

## Structured Data Examples

- Pretty much any data stored in a schema database

| Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Size | Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

- Text data (CSV, JSON) can have structure too

JSON data 

```json 
{   "name" : "Joe",
    "email" : "joe@gmail.com" }
```

CSV data (Comma Seperated Values)
```
joe,joe@gmail.com 
jane,jane@gmail.com
```

---

## Unstructured Data Examples


- Text
    - Documents : email, word documents 
    - Survey results (customer feedback)
    - customer support ticket notes 

- Binary data 
    - Audio (phone call recordings)
    - Video (YouTube videos)
    
<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/cat-2.jpg" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;max-width:100%;" width="20%" />


---

## Semi-Structured Data 

- This is 'between' structured and and unstructured

- Data has some structure, but it may not be well defined

- Example, tweet data

```json 
{   "user_id" : "user123", 
    "timestamp" : "2018-09-20 12:00:05 EST",
    "device" : "iPhone X",
    "location" : "34.893, 120.979",
    "tweet" : "Enjoying my first Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks in Seattle downtown  #PSL, @Starbucks",
    "image_url" : "https://imgurl.com/1234"
}
```

**Question to the class: What data points you can extract from above tweet?      Which is structured / unstructured?**

---

## Data Growth Trends

- Humanity is producing data at a rapid clip
    - TODO : insert some stats

- As you can see, unstructured data is growing rapidly

## Question For The Class 

**Q: Can you name some examples of structured/unstructured data is generated at your home ?**


| Structured Data | Unstructured Data |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| ???             | ???               |

---

## Data And AI 

- Majority of the machine learning projects use 'structured data'
    - predicting house prices, identifying credit card transactions ..etc.
    
- This will continue to grow as we get more and more data, and enterprises adopt more AI

- We are only able to make significant headways in processing unstructured data 
    - images , videos
    
- This is largely due to the advances of neural nets


---

## Scaling with Data


 * Deep Learning Algorithms scale better with data

## Dos and Don'ts For Collecting Data for AI

AI starts with data, in this section we are going to look at some best practices 

- How to acquire data 

- How to curate/clean data 

- How to deal with 'big data'

---

## Acquiring Data

- Best data is the one you already have or  can collect on your own 
    - Data you already have in your database (e.g. customer data)
    - Website logs 
    
- Data can be acquired from 'data brokers'
    - e.g. Stock market data

- Some data is free 
    - e.g. Census data


---

## Data Responsibilities 

- Usually IT team is responsible building the data infrastructure

- AI team 'uses' data  (they are IT team's clients)

- Mistake:  Spend a lot of time gathering data and then involve AI team
    - Not all data may be useful.  
    - Involve AI team early on, so they can give feedback on data

---

## Dealing With Big Data

- Most machine learning doesn't necessarily need 'Big Data'
    - Even modest data can yield surprisingly decent results
    
- However, more data can significantly produce better results

---

## Comprehending Data Sizes 

| Unit      | Acronym | Size       | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Big Data

- Traditionally structured data has been stored in databases

- How ever databases have their limitations:
    - they don't scale to huge data sizes
    - or they can be incredibly expensive to store large amount of data 
    - they don't handle unstructured data well


<img src="../assets/images/bigdata/bigdata-pyramid2.png" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;max-width:100%;width:30%;"/>

---

## Big Data Systems 

- Storing big data requires large 'cluster' systems 

- Choices
    - On premise :  Hadoop 
    - Cloud storage : Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure storage

---

## Hadoop

- Hadoop was developed at Yahoo and open sourced around 2006

- Became 'the' platform for Big Data -- namely on premise

- Hadoop provides **distributed storage** and **distributed computing**

- Can scale upto 1000s of nodes

## Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

| Features                             | Machine Learning                                              | Deep Learning                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data size,(see next slide for graph) | Performs reasonably well on small / medium data               | Need large amount of data for reasonable performance             |
| Scaling                              | Doesn't scale with large amount of data                       | Scales well with large amount of data                            |
| Compute power                        | Doesn't need a lot of compute (works well on single machines) | Needs a lot of compute power (usually runs on clusters)          |
| CPU/GPU                              | Mostly CPU bound                                              | Can utilize GPU for certain computes (massive matrix operations) |
| Feature Engineering                  | Features needs to specified manually (by experts)             | DL can learn high level features from data automatically         |
| Execution Time                       | Training usually takes seconds, minutes, hours                | Training takes lot longer (days)                                 |
| Interpretability                     | Easy to interpret                                             | Hard to understand the final result                              |
| Data Formats                         | Structured data                                               | Can handle unstructured data                                     |

## Deciding Between Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL)

- This is not an easy decision, but here are some factors to think about 

- Have structured data?  Then both ML and DL can be used 

- Got unstructured data?  Probably deep learning 

- Do keep in mind, deep learning usually needs 
    - lot of data 
    - and lot of compute time   
    to produce good results

## Types of Machine Learning

 *  **Supervised Machine Learning:**

     - Model learns from labeled training data

     - And predicts on new data

 *  **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

     - Model tries to find natural patterns in the data

 *  **Semi-Supervised Learning**

     - Model is trained with a training set which contains unlabeled (usually lot) and labeled (usually little) data

     - Example: Large images archive only a few of them are labeled (cat, dog, person) and majority are unlabelled

 *  **Reinforcement Learning**

     - Based on 'game play'  (rewards vs penalties)

## Machine Learning Types: Supervised

 * Model learns from (training) data

 * Then predicts on 'unseen' data

| Algorithms     | Description                                                            | Applications                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Classification | Categorize things into groups                                          | -Spam classification,Fraud / no fraud       |

Notes:


---

## Supervised Learning Methodology

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: Train model(Training set should represent data well enough)

     - Test set: Validate the model

 * Initially 70% training, 30% test

 * Sometimes, 60% training, 20% cross-validation, 20% test

 * Tweak the dials to increase or decrease the proportion

## Supervised Learning - Classification


 * Classification is a model that predicts data into "buckets"

 * Examples:

     - Email is  **SPAM**  or  **HAM**  (not-SPAM)

     - A cell is  **cancerous**  or  **healthy**

     - Hand-written numbers --> any digits 0, 1, 2,..., 9

 * Classification algorithm learns from training data

     - Supervised learning

 * Also predicted classes are " **discrete** " or " **qualitative** "

## Classification Applications


 * Web

     - Email is spam or not

     - Website is authentic or fraudulent

 * Medicine

     - Is this cell cancerous or not?

 * Finance

     - Credit card transaction fraudulent or not

 * OCR

     - Recognizing characters and symbols

## Machine Learning Types: Un Supervised

 * No training needed

 * Algorithm tries to find patterns in data


| Algorithms               | Description                             | Applications                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clustering               | Find naturally present patterns in data | -Identify news stories (sports / business),-Gnome clustering |
| Association              | Find similar patterns                   | -people who buy A also buy B                                 |
| Dimensionality Reduction | Reduces number of features              | -Reducing 1000s of variables into manageable size            |

## Unsupervised Machine Learning


 * Draw inference from input data without "labeled responses"

 * Common clustering algorithms

     - K-means: Group data points into cluster

     - Hidden Markov Model: State transitions

 * Example applications:

     - Find patterns in data

     - Gene expression analysis

     - Recover states from results of random transitions

Notes:

## Clustering Use Cases: Fraud / Anomaly Detection


 * Anomaly detection

     - Find fraud

     - Detect network intrusion attack

     - Discover problems on servers

 * Clustering does not necessarily detects fraud

     - But it points to unusual data

     - And the need for further investigation

## Clustering


 * Clustering finds natural groupings in data

 * Humans naturally cluster data we encounter

     - Categorizing, organizing, etc.

     - Our brains seek patterns

 * Why do we cluster?

     - To understand our data

     - To find "more like this"

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/Clustering-01.png" alt="Clustering-01.png" style="width:50%;"/>


Notes:

Clustering allows us to group similar objects or events or data sets.
This is a method of unsupervised learning.



---

## Clustering Applications


 * Biology

     - Genomics grouping

 * Medicine

     - Xray/CAT image analysis

 * Marketing

     - Consumer grouping ("soccer mom"...etc.) and behavior analysis

 * Web

     - Search result grouping

     - News article grouping (Google news)

 * Computer Science

     - Image analysis

## Reinforcement Learning


 * Imagine you are playing a new video game.  You have no idea how to play it.How will you learn?

 * Try a few things:

- Open a door --> get more money / ammo
- Jump from a cliff --> got hurt.. Loose health points .. Ouch!


 * This is how 'Reinforcement Learning' works.

     - Algorithm tries a few moves.. And learns automatically

## How to do Machine Learning


 *  **1 - Problem Definition:** What are we trying to solve

 *  **2 - Collect data** More data we have, the better the algorithms become.  This data can come from internal logs (clickstreams) or external sources (credit scores of customers)

 *  **3 - Prepare Data** Raw data is hardly in a form to be used.  It needs to be cleansed, tagged and curated before ready to use

 *  **4 - Train a model** Feed the training data to model so it can learn

 *  **5 - Evaluate the model** Test the model accuracy

 *  **6 - Improve the model** Either by adding more training data, choosing a different algorithm

 *  **7 - Deploy the model**

Notes:




---

## 1 - Problem Definition


 * This may not be as easy as it seems

 * Known Knowns

     - Daily web traffic

 * Known Unknowns

     - What are most popular pages?

     - Do big connectors matter in a social graph?

 * Unknown Unknowns

     - Is there a connection between X and Y

Notes:

## Class Discussion:


 * What are some of the problems you are facing that Data Science / Machine Learning might be a solution?

Notes:


---

## 2 - Collecting Data


 * Data Sources can be

     - External: government data, public data,...

     - Internal: collected data (clickstream etc.)

 * External Data challenges

     - Compliance, security concerns,...

     - How much can we get? API throttling.

     - Is the data in useable format?

 * May need to bring data from different systems and in usually in different formats.

     - Clicklogs are text files.

     - Customer data can be from a database.

## Class Discussion: Data Collection Challenges


 * What are some of the problems you are facing / anticipating for collecting data?

Notes:


---

## 3 - Data Preparation / Cleaning


 * Problems with raw data sets

     - Non-usable format (say in Excel spreadsheet format)

     - Contains errors & wrong values

     - Missing values

     - Data is spread across multiple silos

 * Data scientists spend a lot of time cleaning and massaging raw data, to get them ready for analysis.

 * Crucial part of data science

 * Can consume a lot of time (50% - 80%  of the project!!!)

 * Least sexy

## Class Discussion: Data Cleanup


 *  **What do you think involves in cleaning up data?**

Notes:




---

## 3.5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


 * Before doing `machine learning` on data, understand the data.

 * Basic questions

     - Is there a pattern?

     - Are there lot of outliers?  (May skew analysis. Should we keep these or throw them away?)

 *  **Visualizations**  can help greatly!

     - Just do some quick & dirty graphs.

 * Identify `interesting segments`

 * Need to sample?  Or process entire data set?

Notes:


---

## 4 - Model Building


 * Don't do this until you have a good understanding of data.(See previous section.)

 * Pick right modeling technique

     - Clustering

     - Classifications

     - Etc.

 * Pick the right model for data

     - Don't get 'hung up' on one model.

     - Try a few to identify the best fitting model.

     - Experience counts!

## 4.5 - Experiment to Production ('Mind the Gap')


 * Data Scientists develop their models on laptops with small data

 * There is a 'deployment gap' when it comes time to go to production

 * Solutions:

     - Frameworks like Spark are solving this

     - Cloud vendors are providing solution

---

## 5 - Model Validation


 * Models need to be `verified`  / `validated`

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: build / train model

     - Test set: validate the model

 * Initially 70% training,  30% validation.

 * Tweak the dials to decrease training and increase validation.

 * Training set should represent data well enough.

Notes:




---

## 6 - Improving the Model


 * Sometimes we don't get desired accuracy from the model

     - Say we need 90% accuracy, but the model is only at 70%

 * How to improve?

     - Can we find more training data?

     - Tune model parameters

     - Or even choose another model

Notes:




---

## 7 - Deploy Model


 * We are happy with the model's performance

 * So we deploy the model on production / live system where it can start predicting / inferring

 * Monitor the model in production

## Facebook's Bots Invent their own language


 * Facebook designed to chat bots to talk to each other

 * They were communicating with each other freely

 * After a year


       - `Bob: "I can can I I everything else."`

       - `Alice: "Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to."`


 * This indecipherable language is actually a 'new bot language'

 * Bots developed this on their own

 * FB discontinued the experiment
