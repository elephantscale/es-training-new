## Use Case : Photobucket

- [Photobucket](http://photobucket.com/) is a image / video hosting service

- They want to identify and tag NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images and offensive images

- Previously, their human moderation team was only able to monitor about 1% of content

- Now AI system (Using [Clarify](https://www.clarifai.com/)), screens images and tags them properly.  
Illegal images (child pornography ..etc) are flagged for law enforcement

## AI Chatbots @ Lyft (A personal story)
<img src="../assets/images/logos/lyft-logo-1.png" alt="lyft.png" style="width:20%;float:right;"/>

 * Scenario: I ordered a Lyft car, but the driver went to a wrong location. So I cancelled the ride, but charged a $5 cancellation fee.

 * So I go to Lyft app's help and start a chat with 'customer service'

```
Me: 
    Hi, My driver went to a wrong location.  
    So I had to cancel.  
    But I was charged a cancellation fee.
    Can that be refunded"`

Customer Service: 
    I see, this is your first cancellation in past 2 months.  
    We will refund you the money.Have a nice day!"`
```

- Hightlighs 
     - Resolution time:  **about 20 seconds!**
     - No phone calls,
     - No wait time

## AI in Healthcare

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/AI-in-Healthcare.png" alt="AI-in-Healthcare.png" style="width:50%;float:right;"/>

* DeepMind's AI can detect over 50 eye diseases as accurately as a doctor

* Case study at London's Morefield's Hospital

* Typical eye diagnosis took 2 weeks 

* AI can diagnose it in a flash

* How?
    - The AI system was trained on hundreds of thousands of previous eye scans and their diagnosis 
    - Once it has learned enough then when it sees a new image, it can predict the outcome
    - 90%+ accuracy

# What is AI


---

## Definition of Machine Learning

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Arthur-Samuel.png" alt="Arthur-Samuel.png" style="width:15%;float:right;"/>

> "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."  
>   -- Arthur Samuel (1959)


* Example: Self-driving cars
    - Historical approach:  
    Write a massive program to instruct the car to handle all possible scenarios encountered while driving 
        - This is immensely difficult

    - AI approach:  
        - Let AI learn by observing the scenery and your  reactions
        - Once it learnt enough, let the AI predict the next reaction for a scenary



Notes:

## Spam Detection - Traditional (Rule Based) Approach

* Here is an example of spam detection rule engine

* The rules are coded by developers

* There could be 100s of 1000s of rules!

```java

if (email.from_ip.one_of("ip1", "ip2", "ip3")) {
	result = "no-spam"
}
else if ( email.text.contains ("free loans", "cheap degrees"))
{
	result = "spam"
}

```

Notes:




---

## Spam Detection - AI Approach


 * Show the algorithm with spam and non-spam emails

 * Algorithm 'learns' which attributes are indicative of spam

 * Then algorithm predicts spam/no-spam on new email

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Approach.png" alt="AI-Approach.png" style="width:55%;"/>

Notes:


---

## How is AI Different from Rule Based Systems


 * Rule based systems are static

     - They are programmed in

     - They don't learn from data

 * AI can learn from data

     - It gets better every day with more data it sees

## Generic / Narrow AI

### Artificial Narrow Intelligence  (ANI)
<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Driver_free_car.png" alt="Driver_free_car.png" style="width:25%;float:right;"/>

- Focused on a specific tasks 
- Self driving, smart speaker, image recognition
- Tremendous progress in the last few years



### Artificial Generic Intelligence (AGI)
<img src="../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/terminator-1.jpg" alt="bank-of-america.png" style="width:25%;float:right;"/>

- AI can do anything a human can do 
- We are decades or hundreds of years away from this
- So no need to worry about killer robots yet :-)

# A Brief History of AI

---

## AI Evolution


 * Initial AI thinking was TOP DOWN (or symbolic logic)

 * Write a  **big, comprehensive**  program

     - Program  **all the rules**  (expert systems)

 * Problem:

     - Too many rules

     - Works only for specific domain, e.g. math theorems or chess

 * Success stories: playing chess at the grand master level

     - Domains with limited, clear rules

 * Not so successful: image recognition

Notes:


---

## Another AI Approach - Bottom Up



 * E.g. how babies learn to talk:

     - They don't start by learning the 'rules of the language'
     
     - Learn by example

 * Train computers the similar way
 
 * The focus shifts from  **logic to data**

 * More data --> smarter systems

 * Success stories

     - Image recognition

     - Language translation

     - Self-driving cars

Notes:


---

## AI Success Story : Translation - Early Approach

 * Creating a translation system (English <--> Japanese) involes the following

     - English dictionary + grammar rules

     - Japanese dictionary + grammar rules

     - Translation rules

 * Now the system is ready to translate

 * But this approach really doesn't work well:

     - Rules have too many exceptions

     - Context and subtle meanings are lost

 * Example : "Minister of agriculture" --> "Priest of farming"

Notes:


---

## Translation - AI Approach (Google Translate)


 * Google Translate switched to 'Google Brain' on Sept 2016

 * System learned from 'data'

 * AI based system improved the accuracy many times over

## A Glimpse of AI History

 * Sixties

     - Commercial computers & mainframes

     - Computers play chess

 * Eighties

     - Artificial intelligence (AI) get  **'oversold** ', doesn't live up to the promise and gets a bad rap

 * 21st century

     - Big Data changes it all

Notes:


---

## The Great AI Revival - 21st century (2010 on)


 * AI is going through a resurgence now

 *  **'Big Data** ' - now we have so much data to train our models

 *  **'Big Data ecosystem** ' - excellent big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL) are available as open source

 *  **'Big Compute** ' - **cloud**  platforms significantly lowered the barrier to massive compute power

     - $1 rents you 16 core + 128 G + 10 Gigabit machine for 1 hr on AWS!
     - So running a 100 node cluster for 5 hrs --> $500

 *  **Advances in hardware** - CPU / GPUs / TPUs
 
 - **Advances in Algorithms**

 - **Availability of pre-trained models**

## Hardware - GPU


 * Recently GPUs - Graphics Processing Units - have become popular (especially in Deep Learning)

 * GPU cores are good at compute intensive calculations (math, matrix operations)

 * Each GPU core is capable of executing small set instructions, but there are 1000s of core per GPU

     - Running in parallel

## Incredible Growth of AI Power


 * Since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.5 month-doubling time (by comparison, Moore's Law had an 18-month doubling period)Source: (https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/)
 * Phases:
     - Before 2012: It was uncommon to use GPUs for ML, making any of the results in the graph difficult to achieve.
     - 2012 to 2014: Infrastructure to train on many GPUs was uncommon, so most results used 1-8 GPUs rated at 1-2 TFLOPS for a total of 0.001-0.1 pfs-days.
     - 2014 to 2016: Large-scale results used 10-100 GPUs rated at 5-10 TFLOPS, resulting in 0.1-10 pfs-days. Diminishing returns on data parallelism meant that larger training runs had limited value.
     - 2016 to 2017: Approaches that allow greater algorithmic parallelism such as huge batch sizes, architecture search, and expert iteration, along with specialized hardware such as TPU's and faster interconnects, have greatly increased these limits, at least for some applications.

## Advances in Deep Learning Research

- In recent years, lot of money is chasing Deep Learning

- Companies like Google / Facebook / Amazon are in an 'arms race' to hire the best talent in AI

- Lot of research going on in public / private sectors

- Organizations like OpenAI are fostering research in public domain

---
## Creating Deep Learning Models Have Become Easier

- Historically, neural network models had to be coded from scratch
    - Converting math into code, testing and debugging
    - This could take weeks or months

- **Now tooling and libraries have gotten so much better**
    - High level tools like Keras and efficient libraries like Tensorflow, allow us to code complex models very quickly

---
## Availability of Pre-Trained Models

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/standing-on-shoulders.jpg" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;float:right;max-width:100%;" width="20%" />


- Creating complex models takes lot of data and lot of training
    - this can take huge amount of compute power (days or weeks of training)

- Now, we don't have to start from scratch

- There are lot of high quality models that are open source.  We can start with them and tweak them to fit our needs

- _This is probably the biggest reason DL has become mainstream_

- See example on next slide

## Model Zoos

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/zoo1.png" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;max-width:100%;float:right;" width="50%" />

- Building and training complex models from scratch takes a lot of effort and compute

- Luckily, there are lot models available publicly  
    - Computer vision models : LeNet, AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Inception

- Available model zoos
    - [Tensorflow model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
    - [Caffe model zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo)



---


## Building on Other Models

- Say we want to develop a model that can classify people into male / female

- Rather than starting from scratch, we can start with a model that can recognize peopole

- And then train it more to classify them into male/female

## AI Vocabulary: Data Science 

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/Data-Science.png" alt="Data-Science.png" style="width:30%;float:right;"/>

- **Data Science** : Deriving intelligence from data 

- For example, a real estate company can use data science to figure out which types of homes to build to maximize profits

- A machine learning algorithm can learn from the past data and predict house prices for new houses coming on market

| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Sale Price (in thousands) (we are trying to predict) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

## Data Science vs. Machine Learning

- **Data Science** works with existing data and derive intelligence 

- **Machine Learning** learns from existing data and predicts on new/unseen data 

- The definitions are not clear-cut,  some people use these interchangeably

## AI Vocabulary : Neural Networks

 - Layers of parallel processing elements, working together to solve very complex tasks

 - Inspired by neurons from human brain

 - Used in Deep Learning

 - (More on this later)

## AI Vocabulary : Training vs. Inference

*  **Training**
    - Feeding data to an algorithm to create a model
    - Computationally expensive (can take hours, days, weeks)
        - Google translate model trains on 3 billion+ words on 100+ GPUs for week+
*  **Prediction / Inference**
    - Created model answering questions (very fast)
    - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - "What are the recommended movies for this user"

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Vocabulary.png" alt="AI-Vocabulary.png" style="max-width:100%;width:70%;"/>

---

## Data Size Vs. Model Size

- An algorithm can train on small / large / huge amount of data (depending on problem complexity)
    - Since it can be computationally very intensive;  So we may use cluster of computers for training
    - Clusters can contain 100s (or 1000s) of CPUs/GPUs/TPUs

- The resulting model is orders of magnitude smaller in size 
    - it could fit in your phone!

## AI Vocabulary: Algorithm vs. Model

* **Algorithm**
    - Algorithms are 'generic' mathematical formulas 
* **Model**
    - algorithm + data ==> model 
* Often Algorithm and Model are used interchangeably

# AI and Data

---

## AI Starts with Data 

- Lot of AI algorithms learn from data 

- Generally, more data usually makes smarter algorithms 
    - There are exceptions to this 


---

## Learning From Data 

- Let's start with simple housing sales data 

| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Sale Price (in thousands) (we are trying to predict) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

- An machine learning algorithm learns from the above data, and then tries to predict house prices on new data 


| Bedrooms (input 1) | Bathrooms (input 2) | Size (input 3) | Predicted Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 2                   | 1900           | ???                                 |
| 4                  | 3                   | 2300           | ???                                 |

---
## Learning Process

 *  **Phase 1 : Training**
     - Algorithm learns from the data to create a model
     - This step can get computationally expensive.  
     Hours / days / weeks (this is why we use GPU / TPUs  and clusters of computers)
 *  **Phase 2 : Prediction / Inference**
     - Once a model is created it can answer questions 
        - "what would be the sale price for this house"
        - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"
    - Prediction is very fast (milli seconds)

## Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

| Structured Data                                          | Unstructured Data                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Data has well defined structure.                         | Structure is not well defined or non existing |
| Data in a database tables are well defined.  10 columns, first column is integer, second column is timestamp ..etc | videos, images                                             |

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Structured-Data-Unstructured-Data.png" alt="Structured-Data-Unstructured-Data.png" style="width:40%;"/>
---

## Structured Data Examples

- Pretty much any data stored in a schema database

| Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Size | Sale Price (in thousands) |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3                  | 1                   | 1500           | 230                                                  |
| 3                  | 2                   | 1800           | 320                                                  |
| 5                  | 3                   | 2400           | 600                                                  |
| 4                  | 2                   | 2000           | 500                                                  |
| 4                  | 3.5                 | 2200           | 550                                                  |

- Text data (CSV, JSON) can have structure too

JSON data 

```json 
{   "name" : "Joe",
    "email" : "joe@gmail.com" }
```

CSV data (Comma Seperated Values)
```
joe,joe@gmail.com 
jane,jane@gmail.com
```

---

## Unstructured Data Examples


- Text
    - Documents : email, word documents 
    - Survey results (customer feedback)
    - customer support ticket notes 

- Binary data 
    - Audio (phone call recordings)
    - Images
    - Video (YouTube videos)

## Semi-Structured Data 

- This is 'between' structured and and unstructured

- Data has some structure, but it may not be well defined

- Example, tweet data

```json 
{   "user_id" : "user123", 
    "timestamp" : "2018-09-20 12:00:05 EST",
    "device" : "iPhone X",
    "location" : "34.893, 120.979",
    "tweet" : "Enjoying my first Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks in Seattle downtown  #PSL, @Starbucks",
    "image_url" : "https://imgurl.com/1234"
}
```

**Question to the class: What data points you can extract from above tweet?      Which is structured / unstructured?**

---

## Data 

- Humanity is producing data at a rapid clip
    - 90% of data is generated in last 2 years!
    - 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day

## Question For The Class 

**Q: Can you name some examples of structured/unstructured data is generated at your home/work ?**


| Structured Data | Unstructured Data |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| ???             | ???               |

## Data And AI 

- Majority of the machine learning projects use 'structured data'
    - predicting house prices, identifying credit card transactions ..etc.
    
- This will continue to grow as we get more and more data, and enterprises adopt more AI

- We are only able to make significant headways in processing unstructured data 
    - images , videos
    
- This is largely due to the advances of neural nets

## Dos and Don'ts For Collecting Data for AI

AI starts with data, in this section we are going to look at some best practices 

- How to acquire data 

- How to curate/clean data 

- How to deal with 'big data'

---

## Acquiring Data

- Best data is the one you already have or  can collect on your own 
    - Data you already have in your database (e.g. customer data)
    - Website logs 
    
- Data can be acquired from 'data brokers'
    - e.g. Stock market data

- Some data is free 
    - e.g. Census data


---

## Data Responsibilities 

- Usually IT team is responsible building the data infrastructure

- AI team 'uses' data  (they are IT team's clients)

- Mistake:  Spend a lot of time gathering data and then involve AI team
    - Not all data may be useful.  
    - Involve AI team early on, so they can give feedback on data

## Dealing With Big Data

- Most machine learning doesn't necessarily need 'Big Data'
    - Even modest data can yield surprisingly decent results
    
- However, more data can significantly produce better results

## Big Data

<img src="../assets/images/bigdata/bigdata-pyramid2.png" alt="XXX image missing" style="background:white;max-width:100%;width:50%;float:right;"/>

- Traditionally structured data has been stored in databases

- How ever databases have their limitations:
    - they don't scale to huge data sizes
    - or they can be incredibly expensive to store large amount of data 
    - they don't handle unstructured data well



---

## Big Data Systems 

- Storing big data requires large 'cluster' systems 

- Choices
    - On premise :  Hadoop 
    - Cloud storage : Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure storage

---

## Hadoop

- Hadoop was developed at Yahoo and open sourced around 2006

- Became 'the' platform for Big Data -- namely on premise

- Hadoop provides **distributed storage** and **distributed computing**

- Can scale upto 1000s of nodes

# Doing AI Projects 

---

## What Problems Can AI Solve?

- Andrew Ng's  __"one second"__ rule  
"If you can do a task with less than ONE second of thought process, AI can do that easily"

- What AI can do now
    - Classifying email as spam / not spam
    - Translating english sentence to Japanese
    - Identifying an image (car vs boat)
    - Identify damaged products off assembly line
    - Customer support ticket routing
    - self driving car : figuring out what is in front of it
    - Identifying cancer cells from Xray image

<img src="../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/car-3.png" alt="Data-Science.png" style="width:25%;"/>

---

## What AI Can not do 

- **Complex tasks that combines multiple skills**

- Do market research and write a report

- If you don't have enough data
    - if you train AI using 1000s of xray images it can learn to classify.  What if you only have handful of images?  
    AI may not be able to provide good results

- Understand human intension  
For example, if a construction worker is waving you to stop or continue?

<img src="../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/hitchhiker-1.jpg"  style="width:28%;"/>

---

## Some Thoughts on Evaluating  AI Projects

- AI can do 'certain tasks', it may not be able to automate the whole work flow

- For example, let's say we are deploying AI to handle customer tickets.

- AI can easily 'route' tickets to appropriate queues and priorities 
    - "Item arrived late, even though I paid for expedited shippping.  can I get a refund?" ==> Send it to 'refund' queue
    - "Item arrived damaged, can I return it?" ==> send it to 'return' queue
    
- What AI can not do  (the whole workflow):
    - Read the support ticket 
    - call customer to confirm the issue 
    - then issue a refund
    - update the sales register
---

## Some Thoughts on Evaluating  AI Projects

- Do you have enough data to get started?

- For example let's say you want to identify damaged products off the assembly line, do you have enough pictures of good items and damaged items?


<img src="../assets/images/generic/3rd-party/phone-screen-cracked-damage.jpg" alt="Data-Science.png" style="width:25%;"/>

---

## Some Thoughts on Evaluating  AI Projects

- An AI system can evaluate an MRI scan pretty quickly to determine if the patient has a tumor

- How ever it is not going to be able replace an trained oncologist, because they do lot of other things 
    - train interns 
    - consult with patients 
    - evaluate equipments and treatments
    
- So an oncologist may deploy an AI system to help him with reviewing MRI scans quickly.  
So he/she can focus on other 'higher order' functions

---
    
## Quiz For the Class: AI Projects
<img src="../assets/images/icons/quiz-icon.png" style="width:30%;float:right;"/>

- Pick a couple of potential AI projects that is applicable to you 

- What kind of data do you need for machine learning?  
It may help to think along these lines 
    -  Data we already have
    - Data we can collect 
    - 3rd party data - FREE or minimal cost
    - 3rd party data - Premium 

- What kind of data infrastructure do you have now?  Can it scale to handle future growth?

|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data size,(see next slide for graph) | Performs reasonably well on small / medium data               | Need large amount of data for reasonable performance             |
| Scaling                              | Doesn't scale with large amount of data                       | Scales well with large amount of data                            |
| Compute power                        | Doesn't need a lot of compute (works well on single machines) | Needs a lot of compute power (usually runs on clusters)          |
| CPU/GPU                              | Mostly CPU bound                                              | Can utilize GPU for certain computes (massive matrix operations) |
| Feature Engineering                  | Features needs to specified manually (by experts)             | DL can learn high level features from data automatically         |
| Execution Time                       | Training usually takes seconds, minutes, hours                | Training takes lot longer (days)                                 |
| Interpretability                     | Easy to interpret                                             | Hard to understand the final result                              |

## Deciding Between Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL)

- This is not an easy decision, but here are some factors to think about 

- Have structured data?  Then both ML and DL can be used 

- Got unstructured data?  Probably deep learning 

- Do keep in mind, deep learning usually needs 
    - lot of data 
    - and lot of compute time   
    to produce good results

## Types of Machine Learning

 *  **Supervised Machine Learning:**

     - Model learns from labeled training data

     - And predicts on new data

 *  **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

     - Model tries to find natural patterns in the data

 *  **Semi-Supervised Learning**

     - Model is trained with a training set which contains unlabeled (usually lot) and labeled (usually little) data

     - Example: Large images archive only a few of them are labeled (cat, dog, person) and majority are unlabelled

 *  **Reinforcement Learning**

     - Based on 'game play'  (rewards vs penalties)

# ML Algorithms: Supervised

---

## Machine Learning Types: Supervised

 * Model learns from (training) data

 * Then predicts on 'unseen' data

| Algorithms     | Description                                                            | Applications                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Classification | Categorize things into groups                                          | -Spam classification,Fraud / no fraud       |
| Regression     | Dealing with numbers and calculate the probability something happening | -Predict house prices,-Predict stock market |

## Supervised Learning Example - Regression

 * Predicting stock market

 * Train the model using training data (already known)

 * Test performance using test data (already known)

 * Predict no new data (unseen)

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Regression-01.png" alt="Regression-01.png" style="width:55%;"/>


Notes:


---

## Supervised Learning Methodology

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: Train model(Training set should represent data well enough)

     - Test set: Validate the model

 * Training / Test split is traditionally  70% - 30%  or 80% - 20%
    - These are randomly sampled

 * Tweak the dials to increase or decrease the proportion

Notes:

Facebook used 95%/5% `Understanding text from scratch`


---

## Supervised Learning - Classification


 * Classification is a model that predicts data into "buckets"

 * Examples:

     - Email is  **SPAM**  or  **HAM**  (not-SPAM)

     - A cell is  **cancerous**  or  **healthy**

     - Hand-written numbers --> any digits 0, 1, 2,..., 9

 * Classification algorithm learns from training data
 
 * Then predicts on new/unseen data

## Classification Applications


 * Web

     - Email is spam or not

     - Website is authentic or fraudulent

 * Medicine

     - Is this cell cancerous or not?

 * Finance

     - Credit card transaction fraudulent or not

 * OCR

     - Recognizing characters and symbols

## Machine Learning Types: Un Supervised

 * No training needed

 * Algorithm tries to find patterns in data


| Algorithms               | Description                             | Applications                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clustering               | Find naturally present patterns in data | -Identify news stories (sports / business),-Gnome clustering |
| Association              | Find similar patterns                   | -people who buy A also buy B                                 |
| Dimensionality Reduction | Reduces number of features              | -Reducing 1000s of variables into manageable size            |

## Clustering Use Cases: Fraud / Anomaly Detection

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/Clustering-Use-Cases.png" alt="Clustering-Use-Cases.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Anomaly detection

     - Find fraud

     - Detect network intrusion attack

     - Discover problems on servers

 * Clustering does not necessarily detects fraud

     - But it points to unusual data

     - And the need for further investigation


Notes:

## Unsupervised Example: Google News


 * Google News algorithm automatically groups **related news stories**  into sections

* **Question to class** : Why is this not a 'classification' problem, but instead a clustering problem?

## Clustering


 * Clustering finds natural groupings in data

 * Humans naturally cluster data we encounter

     - Categorizing, organizing, etc.

     - Our brains seek patterns

 * Why do we cluster?

     - To understand our data

     - To find "more like this"

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/Clustering-01.png" alt="Clustering-01.png" style="width:50%;"/>


Notes:

## Clustering Applications


 * Biology
     - Genomics grouping
 * Medicine
     - Xray/CAT image analysis
 * Marketing
     - Consumer grouping ("soccer mom"...etc.) and behavior analysis
 * Web
     - Search result grouping
     - News article grouping (Google news)
 * Computer Science
     - Image analysis
 * Climatology
     - Weather pattern analysis (high pressure/warm regions)

## Machine Learning: Semi-Supervised


 * We are still learning, but not all data points are 'labelled'

 * But by grouping data points together, the algorithm can 'infer' information, even when labels are missing

## Reinforcement Learning


 * Imagine you are playing a new video game.  You have no idea how to play it.How will you learn?

 * Try a few things:

- Open a door --> get more money / ammo
- Jump from a cliff --> got hurt.. Loose health points .. Ouch!


 * This is how 'Reinforcement Learning' works.

     - Algorithm tries a few moves.. And learns automatically

## A Brief History: Modelling After Neurons in Brain


 * The human brain is a bunch of interconnected neurons.
 * The neuron is like a "gate" - produces an output
 * Some neurons will only 'fire' if they see color red 
 * Some neurons will only fire if they detect a shape of 'hexagon'
 * If both of these cells fire together the brain can intrepret that I am seeing a red stop sign

## History: 1943: McCulloch Pitts Neural Model


 * McCulloch and Pitts defined a simple model of a Neuron
 * It consisted of N inputs In and N Weights
 * Go to a transfer (sum) function, Apply a threshold to an output
 * Limitations:
     - Binary Output
     - No way to automatically train weights Wn

## Constructing Neural Networks


 * We add multiple layers

 * Each layer can have many neurons

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/hidden-layer.png" alt="hidden-layer.png" style="width:40%;"/>


Notes:


---


## Power of Neural Networks 

- Think of Neurons like 'legos'

- Each neuron will do a little bit work   
But when you stack them and combine them together, they can model some really complex functions 

- This is what makes them incredibly powerful

---


## 'Deep' Neural Networks


 * If the network has more than ONE hidden layer, it is called DEEP network (or more than 3 layers total including input an output)

 * More layers gives the network the ability to adopt complex data

 * How ever more layers take more time to train

## Neural Network Example 

- Say we are trying to build a neural net to predict house prices

- Given a few inputs (Bedrooms, Bathrooms ..etc)  the network has to learn to predict the price

- If we provide enough data to the network, it will automatically learn the functions of each neuron !!

## How to do Machine Learning


 *  **1 - Problem Definition:** What are we trying to solve

 *  **2 - Collect data** More data we have, the better the algorithms become.  This data can come from internal logs (clickstreams) or external sources (credit scores of customers)

 *  **3 - Prepare Data** Raw data is hardly in a form to be used.  It needs to be cleansed, tagged and curated before ready to use

 *  **4 - Train a model** Feed the training data to model so it can learn

 *  **5 - Evaluate the model** Test the model accuracy

 *  **6 - Improve the model** Either by adding more training data, choosing a different algorithm

 *  **7 - Deploy the model**

Notes:




---

## 1 - Problem Definition


 * This may not be as easy as it seems

 * Known Knowns

     - Daily web traffic

 * Known Unknowns

     - What are most popular pages?

     - Do big connectors matter in a social graph?

 * Unknown Unknowns

     - Is there a connection between X and Y

## 2 - Collecting Data

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Workflow-02.png" alt="AI-Workflow-02.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Data Sources can be

     - External: government data, public data,...

     - Internal: collected data (clickstream etc.)

 * External Data challenges

     - Compliance, security concerns,...

     - How much can we get? API throttling.

     - Is the data in useable format?

 * May need to bring data from different systems and in usually in different formats.

     - Clicklogs are text files.

     - Customer data can be from a database.

## 3 - Data Preparation / Cleaning

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Workflow-02.png" alt="AI-Workflow-02.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Problems with raw data sets

     - Non-usable format (say in Excel spreadsheet format)

     - Contains errors & wrong values

     - Missing values

     - Data is spread across multiple silos

 * Data scientists spend a lot of time cleaning and massaging raw data, to get them ready for analysis.

 * Crucial part of data science

 * Can consume a lot of time (50% - 80%  of the project!!!)

 * Least sexy

## 3.5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/EDA-01.png" alt="EDA-01.png" style="width:30%;float:right;"/>

 * Before doing `machine learning` on data, understand the data.

 * Basic questions

     - Is there a pattern?

     - Are there lot of outliers?  (May skew analysis. Should we keep these or throw them away?)

 *  **Visualizations**  can help greatly!

     - Just do some quick & dirty graphs.

 * Identify `interesting segments`

 * Need to sample?  Or process entire data set?




Notes:

## 4 - Model Building

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Workflow-03.png" alt="AI-Workflow-03.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Don't do this until you have a good understanding of data.(See previous section.)

 * Pick right modeling technique

     - Clustering

     - Classifications

     - Etc.

 * Pick the right model for data

     - Don't get 'hung up' on one model.

     - Try a few to identify the best fitting model.

     - Experience counts!



Notes:




---

## 4.5 - Experiment to Production ('Mind the Gap')


 * Data Scientists develop their models on laptops with small data

 * There is a 'deployment gap' when it comes time to go to production

 * Solutions:

     - Frameworks like Spark are solving this

     - Cloud vendors are providing solution

## 5 - Model Validation
 <img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Workflow-04.png" alt="AI-Workflow-04.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Models need to be `verified`  / `validated`

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: build / train model

     - Test set: validate the model

 * Initially 70% training,  30% test

 * Tweak the dials to decrease training and increase validation.

 * Training set should represent data well enough.

## 6 - Improving the Model

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Workflow-05.png" alt="AI-Workflow-05.png" style="width:40%;float:right;"/>

 * Sometimes we don't get desired accuracy from the model

     - Say we need 90% accuracy, but the model is only at 70%

 * How to improve?

     - Can we find more training data?

     - Tune model parameters

     - Or even choose another model



Notes:

## Deep Learning in Mobile

- Why do DL on mobile?
- **Privacy** : so no data leaves the device.  This is important with PII (Personaly Identifiable Information) and Europe's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Reducing Cloud Cost** : By doing DL on the device and minimizing sending data to cloud, we can save time and money
- **Speed** : Sending data to cloud and getting an answer back can take several seconds
    - 10 seconds : user's keep their focus on a screen
    - 1 second : to keep workflow going
    - 0.1 second : users perceive system is working 'instantaneously'
