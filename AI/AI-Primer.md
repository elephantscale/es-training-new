## How Important is AI ?


 * "8 out of 10 companies are already implementing, or planning to adopt AI by 2020"
      - [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/s/delivery_production/docs/FY16h1/doc35/CXResearchVirtualExperiences.pdf)

 * AI is no longer 'novel'

 * Companies are expected to have some AI in their products

     - Just like they are expected to have website that works on a phone

     - Or having an 'app'

# What is AI

Notes:

Primer is pronounced `primmer`

---
## Informal Definition of Machine Learning

 * Arthur Samuel

     -  "**The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**"

 * Example: Self-driving cars

     - Tell the car the rules, or

     - Let it record the scenery and your reactions

     - Let it predict the next reaction

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/3rd-party/Arthur-Samuel.png" alt="Arthur-Samuel.png" style="width:15%;"/>


Notes:


---

## Spam Detection - Traditional (Rule Based) Approach


 * Computers follow explicit instructions (code)

 * Can be tens of millions code lines but still explicit instructions, something like this:

```text
// explicitly coding the rules

if (email.from_ip.one_of("ip1", "ip2", "ip3")) {
	result = "no-spam"
}
else if ( email.text.contains ("free loans", "cheap degrees"))
{
	result = "spam"
}

```

Notes:




---

## Spam Detection - AI Approach


 * Show the algorithm with spam and non-spam emails

 * Algorithm 'learns' which attributes are indicative of spam

 * Then algorithm predicts spam/no-spam on new email

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Approach.png" alt=AI-Approach.png" style="width:76%;"/>

Notes:


---

## How is AI Different from Rule Based Systems


 * Rule based systems are static

     - They are programmed in

     - They don't learn from data

 * AI can learn from data

     - It gets better every day with more data it sees

# Understanding AI Vocabulary

Notes:

Primer is pronounced `primmer`

---

## AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning


 *  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Broader concept of "making machines smart"

 *  **Machine Learning:** Current application of AI that machines learn from data using mathematical, statistical models

 *  **Deep Learning: (Hot!)** Using Neural Networks to solve some hard problems

<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-ML-DL.png" alt="AI-ML-DL.png" style="width:30%;"/>

## AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning


<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-ML-DL-02.png" alt="AI-ML-DL-02.png" style="width:50%;"/>

Notes:


---

## AI Vocabulary


 *  **Training**

     - Feeding data to an algorithm to create a model

     - Computationally expensive

 *  **Prediction / Inference**

     - Created model answering questions (very fast)

     - "is this transaction fraud / not-fraud"

     - "What are the recommended movies for this user"


<img src="../assets/images/deep-learning/AI-Vocabulary.png" alt="AI-Vocabulary.png" style="width:50%;"/>

Notes:


---

## AI Vocabulary


 *  **(Artificial) Neural Networks**

     - Layers of parallel processing elements, working together to solve very complex tasks

     - Inspired by neurons from human brain

     - Used in Deep Learning

     - (More on this later)

# A Brief History of AI

Notes:

Primer is pronounced `primmer`

---

## AI Evolution


 * Initial AI thinking was TOP DOWN (or symbolic logic)

 * Write a  **big, comprehensive**  program

     - Program  **all the rules**  (expert systems)

 * Problem:

     - Too many rules

     - Works only for specific domain, e.g. math theorems or chess

 * Success stories: playing chess at the grand master level

     - Domains with limited, clear rules

 * Not so successful: image recognition

Notes:


---

## Another AI Approach - Bottom Up


 * Computers can learn from `ground up` (data-driven)

 * E.g. how babies learn to talk:

     - Learn from example

     - They don't know the 'whole dictionary' or 'grammatical rules'

 * The focus shifts from  **logic to data**

 * More data --> smarter systems

 * Success stories

     - Image recognition

     - Language translation

     - Self-driving cars

Notes:


---

## Translation - Early Approach

 * Creating a translation system from English <--> Japanese

 * Code in the following:

     - English dictionary + grammar rules

     - Japanese dictionary + grammar rules

     - Translation rules

 * Now the system is ready to translate

 * But this approach really doesn't work well:

     - Rules have too many exceptions

     - Context and subtle meanings are lost

 * "Minister of agriculture" --> "Priest of farming"

Notes:


---

## Translation - 'Bottom Up' Approach (Google Translate)


 * Google Translate has been ported to 'Google Brain' on Sept 2016

 * System learned from 'data'

## A Glimpse of AI History

 * Sixties

     - Commercial computers & mainframes

     - Computers play chess

 * Eighties

     - Artificial intelligence (AI) get  **'oversold** ', doesn't live up to the promise and gets a bad rap

 * 21st century

     - Big Data changes it all

Notes:

## The Great AI Revival - 21st century (2010 on)


 * AI is going through a resurgence now

 *  **'Big Data** ' - now we have so much data to train our models

 *  **'Big Data ecosystem** ' - excellent big data platforms (Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL) are available as open source

 *  **'Big Compute** ' - **cloud**  platforms significantly lowered the barrier to massive compute power

     - $1 buys you 16 core + 128 G + 10 Gigabit machine for 1 hr on AWS!
     - So running a 100 node cluster for 5 hrs --> $500

 *  **Advances in hardware** - CPU / GPUs

## Incredible Growth of AI Power


 * Since 2012, the amount of compute used in the largest AI training runs has been increasing exponentially with a 3.5 month-doubling time (by comparison, Moore's Law had an 18-month doubling period)Source: (https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/)

 * Phases:

     - Before 2012: It was uncommon to use GPUs for ML, making any of the results in the graph difficult to achieve.

     - 2012 to 2014: Infrastructure to train on many GPUs was uncommon, so most results used 1-8 GPUs rated at 1-2 TFLOPS for a total of 0.001-0.1 pfs-days.

     - 2014 to 2016: Large-scale results used 10-100 GPUs rated at 5-10 TFLOPS, resulting in 0.1-10 pfs-days. Diminishing returns on data parallelism meant that larger training runs had limited value.

     - 2016 to 2017: Approaches that allow greater algorithmic parallelism such as huge batch sizes, architecture search, and expert iteration, along with specialized hardware such as TPU's and faster interconnects, have greatly increased these limits, at least for some applications.

## Types of Machine Learning

 *  **Supervised Machine Learning:**

     - Model learns from labeled training data

     - And predicts on new data

 *  **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

     - Model tries to find natural patterns in the data

 *  **Semi-Supervised Learning**

     - Model is trained with a training set which contains unlabeled (usually lot) and labeled (usually little) data

     - Example: Large images archive only a few of them are labeled (cat, dog, person) and majority are unlabelled

 *  **Reinforcement Learning**

     - Based on 'game play'  (rewards vs penalties)

## Machine Learning Types: Supervised

 * Model learns from (training) data

 * Then predicts on 'unseen' data

| Algorithms     | Description                                                            | Applications                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Classification | Categorize things into groups                                          | -Spam classification,Fraud / no fraud       |
| Regression     | Dealing with numbers and calculate the probability something happening | -Predict house prices,-Predict stock market |

## Supervised Learning Example - Regression

 * Predicting stock market

 * Train the model using training data (already known)

 * Test performance using test data (already known)

 * Predict no new data (unseen)


Notes:


---

## Supervised Learning Methodology

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: Train model(Training set should represent data well enough)

     - Test set: Validate the model

 * Initially 70% training, 30% test

 * Sometimes, 60% training, 20% cross-validation, 20% test

 * Tweak the dials to increase or decrease the proportion

## Supervised Learning - Classification


 * Classification is a model that predicts data into "buckets"

 * Examples:

     - Email is  **SPAM**  or  **HAM**  (not-SPAM)

     - A cell is  **cancerous**  or  **healthy**

     - Hand-written numbers --> any digits 0, 1, 2,..., 9

 * Classification algorithm learns from training data

     - Supervised learning

 * Also predicted classes are " **discrete** " or " **qualitative** "



Notes:


---

## Classification Applications


 * Web

     - Email is spam or not

     - Website is authentic or fraudulent

 * Medicine

     - Is this cell cancerous or not?

 * Finance

     - Credit card transaction fraudulent or not

 * OCR

     - Recognizing characters and symbols

 * Draw inference from input data without "labeled responses"

 * Common clustering algorithms

     - K-means: Group data points into cluster

     - Hidden Markov Model: State transitions

 * Example applications:

     - Find patterns in data

     - Gene expression analysis

     - Recover states from results of random transitions

## Clustering Use Cases: Fraud / Anomaly Detection


 * Anomaly detection

     - Find fraud

     - Detect network intrusion attack

     - Discover problems on servers

 * Clustering does not necessarily detects fraud

     - But it points to unusual data

     - And the need for further investigation


Notes:

## Unsupervised Example: Google News


 * Google News algorithm automatically groups **related news stories**  into sections


Notes:

## Clustering


 * Clustering finds natural groupings in data

 * Humans naturally cluster data we encounter

     - Categorizing, organizing, etc.

     - Our brains seek patterns

 * Why do we cluster?

     - To understand our data

     - To find "more like this"

Notes:

Clustering allows us to group similar objects or events or data sets.
This is a method of unsupervised learning.

## Clustering Applications


 * Biology

     - Genomics grouping

 * Medicine

     - Xray/CAT image analysis

 * Marketing

     - Consumer grouping ("soccer mom"...etc.) and behavior analysis

 * Web

     - Search result grouping

     - News article grouping (Google news)

 * Computer Science

## Reinforcement Learning


 * Imagine you are playing a new video game.  You have no idea how to play it.How will you learn?

 * Try a few things:

- Open a door --> get more money / ammo
- Jump from a cliff --> got hurt.. Loose health points .. Ouch!


 * This is how 'Reinforcement Learning' works.

     - Algorithm tries a few moves.. And learns automatically

## How to do Machine Learning


 *  **1 - Problem Definition:** What are we trying to solve

 *  **2 - Collect data** More data we have, the better the algorithms become.  This data can come from internal logs (clickstreams) or external sources (credit scores of customers)

 *  **3 - Prepare Data** Raw data is hardly in a form to be used.  It needs to be cleansed, tagged and curated before ready to use

 *  **4 - Train a model** Feed the training data to model so it can learn

 *  **5 - Evaluate the model** Test the model accuracy

 *  **6 - Improve the model** Either by adding more training data, choosing a different algorithm

 *  **7 - Deploy the model**

Notes:




---

## 1 - Problem Definition


 * This may not be as easy as it seems

 * Known Knowns

     - Daily web traffic

 * Known Unknowns

     - What are most popular pages?

     - Do big connectors matter in a social graph?

 * Unknown Unknowns

     - Is there a connection between X and Y

Notes:

## Class Discussion:


 * What are some of the problems you are facing that Data Science / Machine Learning might be a solution?

Notes:


---

## 2 - Collecting Data


 * Data Sources can be

     - External: government data, public data,...

     - Internal: collected data (clickstream etc.)

 * External Data challenges

     - Compliance, security concerns,...

     - How much can we get? API throttling.

     - Is the data in useable format?

 * May need to bring data from different systems and in usually in different formats.

     - Clicklogs are text files.

     - Customer data can be from a database.

Notes:

---

## Class Discussion: Data Collection Challenges


 * What are some of the problems you are facing / anticipating for collecting data?

Notes:


---

## 3 - Data Preparation / Cleaning


 * Problems with raw data sets

     - Non-usable format (say in Excel spreadsheet format)

     - Contains errors & wrong values

     - Missing values

     - Data is spread across multiple silos

 * Data scientists spend a lot of time cleaning and massaging raw data, to get them ready for analysis.

 * Crucial part of data science

 * Can consume a lot of time (50% - 80%  of the project!!!)

 * Least sexy



Notes:


---

## Class Discussion: Data Cleanup


 *  **What do you think involves in cleaning up data?**

Notes:




---

## 3.5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


 * Before doing `machine learning` on data, understand the data.

 * Basic questions

     - Is there a pattern?

     - Are there lot of outliers?  (May skew analysis. Should we keep these or throw them away?)

 *  **Visualizations**  can help greatly!

     - Just do some quick & dirty graphs.

 * Identify `interesting segments`

 * Need to sample?  Or process entire data set?


Notes:




---

## 4 - Model Building


 * Don't do this until you have a good understanding of data.(See previous section.)

 * Pick right modeling technique

     - Clustering

     - Classifications

     - Etc.

 * Pick the right model for data

     - Don't get 'hung up' on one model.

     - Try a few to identify the best fitting model.

     - Experience counts!

Notes:




---

## 4.5 - Experiment to Production ('Mind the Gap')


 * Data Scientists develop their models on laptops with small data

 * There is a 'deployment gap' when it comes time to go to production

 * Solutions:

     - Frameworks like Spark are solving this

     - Cloud vendors are providing solution

https://www.slideshare.net/julesdamji/apache-spark-mllib-2x-how-to-productionize-your-machine-learning-models

---

## 5 - Model Validation


 * Models need to be `verified`  / `validated`

 * Split the data set into

     - Training set: build / train model

     - Test set: validate the model

 * Initially 70% training,  30% validation.

 * Tweak the dials to decrease training and increase validation.

 * Training set should represent data well enough.

Notes:




---

## 6 - Improving the Model


 * Sometimes we don't get desired accuracy from the model

     - Say we need 90% accuracy, but the model is only at 70%

 * How to improve?

     - Can we find more training data?

     - Tune model parameters

     - Or even choose another model

Notes:




---

## 7 - Deploy Model


 * We are happy with the model's performance

 * So we deploy the model on production / live system where it can start predicting / inferring

 * Monitor the model in production



Notes:

     - Issues

     - Best practices?

## AI in the Cloud


 * Pretty much all cloud vendors have a cloud based AI offering

 * 'AI as Service'

 * Benefits of cloud

     - Not having to worry about infrastructure

     - Scalable infrastructure (start small, grow as needed)

     - Pay per use model

     - 'Deployment gap' is no longer an issue

 * Go from experiment to production very quickly

## Facebook's Bots Invent their own language


 * Facebook designed to chat bots to talk to each other

 * They were communicating with each other freely

 * After a year


       - `Bob: "I can can I I everything else."`

       - `Alice: "Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to."`


 * This indecipherable language is actually a 'new bot language'

 * Bots developed this on their own

 * FB discontinued the experiment

## Amazon uses AI to Identify Job Applicants


 * Amazon tried an AI algorithm to short-list candidates

 * The algorithm was trained by job applications submitted in 10 year period

 *  **The algorithm was selecting mostly men for technical positions**

     - Because the training data had male bias
