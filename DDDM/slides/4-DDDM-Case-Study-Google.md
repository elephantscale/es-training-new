# Case Study: Google

## About Google

 * Google’s mission:
 * "To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful."
 * And in pursuing this mission, the company is very serious about using information to inform their decisions.
 * Founded by two engineers, Google is a company where:
   - data-driven insights are part of its DNA, 
   - Googlers (employees in Google) speak the language of data as part of their culture. 
 * In fact, Google aims to make all decisions based on data and analytics.

## Defining objectives and information needs

Data can provide much-needed answers, but only if you are clear about the questions you need to answer
 * Google aims to start with these questions and be very clear about the information it needs at the outset
 * As the company’s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, has said, “We run the company by questions, not by answers.”
 * Within its global HR function, Google has created a people analytics department that enables the organization to make data-driven people decisions
 * One question Google wanted to answer was, “Do managers actually matter?” This is a question Google had been wrestling with for years; at one point, the company actually got rid of all managers and made everyone an individual contributor
 * This did not really work, and managers were brought back in, but the suspicion lingered that managers perhaps were not that important.
 * So, Google had identified a critical people-related question that it wanted to answer: Do managers matter?

## Collecting Data

 * To start with, the people analytics team looked at the data sources that already existed: performance reviews (top-down reviews of managers) and employee surveys (bottom-up reviews of managers)
 * The team took this data and plotted it on a graph that revealed that managers were generally perceived as good
 * The problem was the data did not really show a lot of variation, so the team decided to split the data into the top and bottom quartiles
 *  Using regression analysis, the team was able to show a big difference between these two groups in terms of team productivity, employee happiness, and employee turnover
 * In other words, the teams with the better managers performed better, and employees were happier and more likely to stay.

## Collecting Data 
 * This answered the original question – clearly, managers did matter – but it did not really give much in terms of actionable insights
 * So the team came up with a new question that needed answering: “What makes a good manager at Google?” To answer this new question, the team introduced two new data collection methods
 * The first was a “Great Managers Award,” through which employees could nominate managers they felt were particularly good
 * As part of the nomination, employees had to provide examples of behaviors they felt supported their good assessment of managers
 * The second data set came from interviews with the managers in each of the two quartiles (bottom and top) to understand what they were doing or not doing (the managers did not know which quartile they were in.

## Analyzing Data

Data from the manager interviews and the Great Manager Award nomina- Step 3 tions was coded using text analysis to extract the top eight behaviors of a
high-scoring manager, as well as the top three reasons why managers were struggling in their role.
According to the findings, a high-scoring manager displayed the following eight characteristics:
 *  a good coach
 *  empowers the team, does not micromanage
 *  expresses interest / concern for team members’ success and personal wellbeing
 *  productive and results-oriented
 *  a good communicator – listens and shares information
 *  helps with career development
 *  has a clear vision / strategy for the team
 *  has important technical skills that help him / her to advise the team

## Analyzing Data 

 * Following are the three main factors causing managers to struggle: 
   - has a tough transition (e.g., suddenly promoted, or hired from outside with little training)
   - lacks a consistent philosophy / approach to performance management and career development
   -  spends too little time on managing and communicating

---

## Presenting Information

 * Google used different ways of sharing these insights with the relevant managers.
 * The top level team received a newspaper-style report with headlines, graphs and narratives. 
 * Senior and middle managers received a more action-orientated analysis, outlining the findings and expectations for them as a manager.

## Making Data Driven Decisions

 * Google started to measure people against these behaviors and introduced a new bi-annual feedback survey to help with this measurement.
 * Google decided to continue with the Great Manager Award to further measure manager performance.
 * Google revised the management training to support and promote the most desirable management behaviors.

## Another Key Strategic Priortiy: The Earth
 * Google: fully carbon neutral since 2007
 * Datacenters: 2% of global energy usage
 * "How can we reduce energy used to cool datacenters?"
 * Google Developed a Machine Learning Algorithm:
   - These algorithms can spot patterns across various systems
   - see how they impact the cooling infrastructure 
   - make decisions on the best configuration of equipment. 
 * Result: 40% reduction in energy for cooling.
