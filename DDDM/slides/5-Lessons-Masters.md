## The Fallacy of the Gut Feeling

 * Many individuals decide to make decisions based on intuition, or gut.
 * There's a misconception that for the truly gifted, intuition gives them an edge over ordinary decision makers.
 * It's undoubtedly true that some people make better intuitive decisions than others.
 * Human nature is such that even the most gifted intuitive thinkers will be subject to bias that afflict human nature.

## Confirmation Bias

 * Confirmation Bias means that humans naturally put their pre-existing beliefs first
   - It is human nature that a pre-existing belief will only be surrendered with difficulty (if at all) in the face of contradictory evidence.
 * Example "A father and son are in a car crash and are rushed to the hospital. The father dies. The boy is taken to the operating room and the surgeon says:
   - "I can't operate on this boy, because he's my son."
 * How is it possible?

## Confirmation Bias
 * If you said, "She was his mother," congradulations! You passed the gender bias test!
 * The point is that our pre-existing assumptions may be difficult to surrender.
 * In the case of mixed data, humans tend to gravitate to towards the data that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.

## Anchor Bias
 * Anchor Bias means that you make a decision based on an initial assumption (called the "anchor).
 * Imagine that you are given a budget for a software purchase of $100,000.00 
 * You come across three proposals:
   - The first company proposes $110k
   - The second proposes $100k
   - The third solution costs $30k.
 * Which do you select?

--- 

## Anchor Bias
 * If you said the second ($100k), you should ask yourself:
   - Why did you select that one?
   - Because it was exactly within your budget?
 * Perhaps the $110k has critical features that are needed!
 * Perhaps the $30k meets all your requirements exactly.
 * In this case, the "anchor" -- the budget amount of $100k, biased our chouice.

## Retrievability Bias
 * This bias means we make decisions based on our most easily retrieved anecdote.
 * Let's say that we want to implement policies to reduce employee turnover.
   - Naturally we think of a recent employee who left the company.
   - It may be that those who left suddenly or abruptly are the ones that are the most memorable.
   - This may cloud our judgement on addressing the broader scope.

---

## Regression Fallacy
 * "Regression Fallacy" means the assumption that "regression to the mean" is the start of a larger trend.
 * For example, let's say that an employee's performance is suffering, possibly due to personal reasons.
   - Her manager may criticize her performance and see how she responds to criticism.
   - If her performance improves, the manager may conclude that the criticism itself was the cause of the improvement.
 * But is it? 
   - It would be natural for a dipping performance to eventually return to the level it was before.
   - This is what statisticians call "regression to the mean."
 * Here the manager made false assumptions!

## Hindsight Bias

 * Hindsight Bias means we reward actions that had good results without considering that it could be random chance that achieved the results.
 * Many financial analysts make their name by making bold predictions.
   - Stock Market Crashing in Q4!
   - Dow up 50% by EOY!
 * Occasionally such bold predictions inevitably turn out correct.
   - The analyst writes books about how "Nobody else correctly called the last recession but me!"
   - When in fact, the law of averages is such that such bold predictions may eventually by random chance be proven correct.
 * Gamblers in Vegas often fall victim to this fallacy of seeing a lucky streak as genius rather than simply probabilities that could change.

## Hyperbolic Discounting Bias
 * Hyperbolic Discounting Bias is when we irrationally assess payoffs based on time.
 * For example, lottery winners are often given a choice between;
   - a one-time payout
   - an annuity.
 * There are many financial and economic tools to assess "the time value of money":
   - to determine whether the annuity or the payout are more valuable.
   - Financial products such as lines of credit could be issued against future winnings to help participants manage cash flow.
 * However, people often make emotional decisions:
   - Give me the money now!
   - I don't want it all at once; I want it a little at a time.

## What to do about biases
 * Realizing that one is subject to biases does not make one a worse person!
   - Actually acknowledging the possibility of bias is a sign of maturity!
   - "I do feel that XYZ is the right thing to do, but I acknowledge I could be influenced by biases."
 * The *possibility* of bias should give us the humility to accept what the data "says" at face value.

# Groupthink

---

## What is GroupThink?
 * "Groupthink" is a phenomenon in which group decision making sometimes have worse outcomes than individual decision making.
 * Groupthink is more than just a human desire for conformity
   - It is a organizational value that values concurrence-seeking above all else.
   - Takes group values uncritically and views attempts to question group values with suspicion. 
 * Causes
   - A group desire for harmony
   - Lack of Diversity
   - Assuming "silence is consent."
