# Tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth to Track Requests Across Services

---

## What is Spring Cloud Sleuth?

- **Definition**: Spring Cloud Sleuth is a distributed tracing library for Spring Boot applications.
- **Purpose**:
  - Add unique trace IDs to logs to track requests across multiple services.
  - Simplify debugging in microservices by providing end-to-end request visibility.
  - Integrate seamlessly with external tracing tools like Zipkin and Jaeger.

Notes:

Spring Cloud Sleuth enhances observability in microservices by enabling distributed tracing and improving troubleshooting.

## Why Use Distributed Tracing?

1. **Challenges Without Tracing**:
   - Debugging is difficult when requests span multiple services.
   - Logs lack a unique identifier to correlate actions across systems.
   - No visibility into bottlenecks or delays in the service flow.

2. **Benefits of Distributed Tracing**:
   - Provides end-to-end visibility for each request.
   - Identifies bottlenecks in service interactions.
   - Correlates logs and metrics with unique trace IDs.

Notes:

Distributed tracing is essential for debugging and performance optimization in microservices architectures.

## Core Features of Spring Cloud Sleuth

1. **Trace and Span IDs**:
   - Assigns a unique trace ID for the request lifecycle and span IDs for each service interaction.

2. **Log Enrichment**:
   - Adds trace and span IDs to logs automatically.

3. **Context Propagation**:
   - Propagates tracing information across service boundaries.

4. **Integration with Tracing Tools**:
   - Works seamlessly with tools like Zipkin, Jaeger, and OpenTelemetry.

Notes:

Spring Cloud Sleuthâ€™s features simplify tracing by automatically instrumenting applications and enriching logs with tracing details.

## How Spring Cloud Sleuth Works

1. **Trace Initialization**:
   - Generates a unique trace ID when a request enters the system.

2. **Span Creation**:
   - Creates spans for each service interaction or operation.

3. **Context Propagation**:
   - Passes trace and span IDs across service boundaries via headers.

4. **Log Enrichment**:
   - Automatically appends trace and span IDs to logs for correlation.

Notes:

Spring Cloud Sleuth seamlessly integrates tracing into the request lifecycle, providing full visibility into service interactions.
